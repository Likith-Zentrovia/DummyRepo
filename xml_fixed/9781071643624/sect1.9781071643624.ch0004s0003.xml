   <title>Presenting Problem</title>
   <para role="Para">When assessing the presenting problem<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>presenting problem</primary>
      </indexterm>, the goal is to learn about the client’s view or perspective of the issue and how it currently affects them, focusing on the aspects that matter most to the client. Though clients may spontaneously share information about the history of their concerns, this section should be focused on current symptoms and problems. To maintain rapport, the clinician can parse out current problems versus the history of current problems later when writing the report, rather than expecting the client to follow the clinician’s outline. When assessing symptoms, the clinician should collect the information in the client’s own words. Do not assume, however, that a client’s use of clinical language has the same meaning as the clinical term, especially given the effects of outside sources, such as social media. As such, the clinician should clarify vague terms or ask for everyday examples (e. g., “When you say you feel depressed, what do you mean? Give me an example of what you experience when feeling depressed”). Some general information may have already been obtained when exploring the client’s referral questions. If the client has not yet described specific symptoms, the clinician should begin this line of inquiry by asking directly (e. g., “What kinds of symptoms, psychological or physical, do you experience related to the problem,” “What symptoms cause you the most difficulty”).</para>
   <para role="Para">Based on the client’s initial description of their symptoms, the clinician may already have one or two diagnostic hypotheses. At this point, narrowing the discussion to specific symptoms and behavioral patterns could be useful in further clarifying the concern(s). At a minimum, the clinician should inquire about current somatic symptoms (pain, cardiovascular or gastrointestinal problems), vegetative symptoms<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>symptoms</primary>
      </indexterm> (sleep, appetite, weight change, energy level, libido), cognitive concerns (thinking ability, attention, memory, executive function), and other emotional or mood symptoms that may be <emphasis>currently</emphasis> present but not yet disclosed. If a client denies symptoms related to primary diagnostic criteria, the clinician usually does not need to follow up with additional questioning of secondary symptoms, although an unusual presentation of symptoms sometimes does occur. This process requires a thorough understanding of the current diagnostic manual, which is the <emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</emphasis> (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">To meet the criteria for DSM diagnoses, clients must endorse specific symptom patterns and report distress, impairment, or dysfunction directly related to the symptoms. Clients may not always feel distressed or exhibit strong insight into the functional effects of their symptoms. Thus, the clinician should consider multiple sources<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>sources</primary>
      </indexterm>of information to supplement the client’s report, such as informant interviews or medical records, to determine the presence of distress or dysfunction. As with other areas of inquiry, the clinician should start with open-ended questions followed by more specific questioning as needed (e. g., “What sort of difficulties has this problem caused you,” “Have you missed work/or school, or been fired, because of your symptoms”). The clinician should be careful not to rely on “yes” or “no” questions about the presence of symptoms. Approaching the interview and diagnostic criteria as a simple checklist can lead to false positives in diagnoses. If the clinician only considers a client’s subjective experience or description of symptoms, they increase the likelihood of misdiagnosis (e. g., attentional difficulties associated<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>associated</primary>
      </indexterm> with Generalized Anxiety Disorder versus ADHD). Additionally, the clinician should inquire about a client’s experience in common areas of functioning, including interpersonal, educational/occupational, and basic/instrumental activities of daily living.</para>
