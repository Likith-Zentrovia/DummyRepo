            <primary>Latina</primary>
         </indexterm> college student, Janice screened positive for suicidal thoughts on an ASQ that was administered by an emergency department (ED) nurse. She was brought to the ED by her roommate who witnessed Janice impulsively overdose on her SSRI antidepressant and medications after a fierce fight and break up with her girlfriend of 3 years. Janice remained extremely anxious, dysregulated, and inconsolable in the ED and was subsequently admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. The day after her admission, Janice met with a psychology intern on the unit who administered a C-SSRS, a Beck Depression Inventory, and a Beck Anxiety Inventory. In addition, the intern also conducted a 45-minute assessment interview.</para>
      <para role="Para">The intern had been well trained in suicide assessment and was both empathic and validating. In the course of their interview, Janice acknowledged that she did not really want to die, stating: “I just didn’t know what else to do—I can’t imagine living without her.” Janice occasionally experienced passing suicidal thoughts<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>behavior</primary>
         </indexterm> that was always triggered by acutely anxious states mostly related to family of origin conflicts. Her family relationships were complicated by years of sexual abuse by her maternal grandfather and her sexual orientation which was unacceptable to her devotedly Catholic family. Janice noted that all her relationships tended to be volatile and intense.</para>
      <para role="Para">After several days on the inpatient unit, Janet was referred to a community treatment center and put on a 3-month waiting list for Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)<indexterm significance="normal">

         <title>Comment on the Case of Janice</title>
         <para role="Para">As a 20-something, marginalized, gay woman, over-dosing on medication following a relationship conflict, Janice represents a modal suicide attempter within the United States. Her history of sexual trauma, anxiety, depression, and self-harm cutting behavior along with volatile relationships all contribute to the complexity of her case. Given this history and set of symptoms, Janice would be an excellent candidate for intensive DBT, but waitlists for receiving this excellent evidence-based treatment are not atypical.</para>
         <para role="Para">Of note, the distinction between her self-harm behaviors and suicide is important to make (and patients need psycho-education on this distinction). Janice did not aspire to terminate her biological existence; she just did not otherwise know how to cope with her intense dysregulation in the wake of her breakup. Her overdose on SSRIs is not objectively lethal but is nevertheless concerning. The absence of any other previous attempts is important. If Janice is able to receive DBT to learn emotion regulation skills and engage in family therapy (and perhaps some trauma-informed therapy), her prognosis could be promising but such care can be elusive, time-consuming, and expensive.</para>

      <title>“Frank”</title>
      <para role="Para">As a divorced, alcoholic, middle-aged (53), white male, electrical engineer, Frank has struggled with a history of depression and several failed attempts to become sober. Estranged from his three sons and at risk of losing his job at a power company, Frank recently bought a handgun and had written several suicide notes to his ex-wife and sons to say goodbye. At work, and to his surprise, Frank broke down in tears and shared with a work colleague that he was depressed and “ready to give up.” The astute<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> colleague walked Frank down to the personnel office and an evaluation with an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</primary>
         </indexterm> psychologist was immediately made.</para>
      <para role="Para">The savvy EAP clinician administered a C-SSRS and noted Frank’s serious suicidal risk. In a calm, even manner, he talked to Frank about possible treatment options that would be covered under the company’s health plan. Frank admitted to the EAP clinician that he was reluctant to reveal his suicidal thinking because he feared being hospitalized against his will. While the clinician acknowledged that hospitalization is sometimes necessary, there are excellent suicide-focused treatments that can be conducted on an outpatient basis. Toward the end of their 2-h interview, the EAP<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>EAP</primary>
         </indexterm> clinician referred Frank to an in-network clinical social worker who could provide an intervention called the “Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality” (CAMS)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>(CAMS)</primary>

         <title>Comment on the Case of Frank</title>
         <para role="Para">In contrast to Janice, Frank is a prime example of a person who dies by suicide in the United States, wherein men—particularly white males—dominate suicide deaths. Frank’s history of depression, alcohol abuse, isolation, and job troubles are all worrisome. Immediately concerning is his purchase of a handgun (the number one method for suicide in the United States); his preparatory behavior of writing suicide notes is also troubling. However, Frank’s lack of any previous suicide attempts is encouraging and the relative “newness” of his suicidal thinking make him an especially good candidate for CAMS which can be safely rendered on an outpatient basis (Jobes,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

            </emphasis>).</para>
         <para role="Para">Within the first session of CAMS<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>CAMS</primary>
            </indexterm>Frank received an in-depth assessment of his suicide risk using a tool called the “Suicide Status Form” that was completed collaboratively by Frank and his clinician (sitting side-by-side). The SSF in-depth assessment led to the development of the CAMS Stabilization Plan and a suicide-focused treatment plan that centered on identifying Franks “drivers” of suicide. In Frank’s case, a key initial intervention involved removing access to the new handgun (which was taken by his co-worker for safe keeping). Frank’s CAMS treatment intensively focused on alleviating his suicidal drivers (i. e., his two problem drivers focused on re-engaging with his sons and getting sober). While Frank is a worrisome clinical presentation, he did not need to be hospitalized because lethal means were quickly secured, a solid Stabilization Plan was established, and he received an evidence-based suicide-focused treatment.</para>
         <para role="Para">The handling of Frank’s case is an excellent example of superb clinical risk management response that is ethical and optimal as least-restrictive, evidence-based, and suicide-focused care was provided, which was in Frank’s best interest and was simply the right thing to do (Jobes &amp; Barnett,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2024</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Two years after six sessions of CAMS<indexterm significance="normal">

            </indexterm>, Frank was sober and spending time with his sons after engaging in successful family therapy. With his suicide clinically averted, and a solid program of sobriety, Frank was dating a woman in recovery and he reported feeling like he had been “reborn” into a life worth living.</para>
