            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although this interview is not used for diagnostic purposes, the CFI is used to ensure that cultural factors are considered in the process of diagnosis and treatment planning. This 20-min interview was designed to equate the importance of the individual perspective with the signs and symptoms of a disorder and provides a semi-structured format to accomplish this goal (Aggarwal &amp; Lewis-Fernández, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The CFI is structured to be straightforward and simple to administer. A total of 16 questions comprises four sections of the interview: cultural definition of the problem; cultural perceptions of cause, context, and support; cultural identity of the individual; and cultural factors affecting self-coping and past help-seeking. When necessary and appropriate, an alternative version of the CFI, the Informant Cultural Formulation Interview, can be conducted with close associates of the client to collect collateral information. This version of the CFI may be particularly helpful when working with clients who have cognitive limitations. The CFI has been administered internationally in field tests and has demonstrated efficacy and improved trust and alliance in the therapeutic relationship (Jarvis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

The current DIS for DSM-5 (DIS-5) consists of 14 diagnostic modules and covers several disorders from categories such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma-and stressor-related disorders, and substance use disorders. However, this interview does not assess separation anxiety disorder, somatic symptoms and related disorders, dissociative disorders, and most sexual disorders. This modular format of the interview allows the interviewer to choose which diagnostic modules to administer, potentially based on symptom presentation.</para>

It is the most comprehensive version of the SCID-5 and includes a broad range of mental health diagnoses, as well as relevant subtypes and specifiers. There are two configurations of the SCID-5-RV available: the “core” version and the “enhanced” version. The “enhanced” version contains all the disorders in the “core” version and includes several optional disorders—separation anxiety disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, gambling disorder, hoarding disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania disorder, and excoriation disorder. The “core” version can be administered in 45–120 min, and the “enhanced” version can be administered in 45–180 min.

This interview is an abridged and modified version of the SCID-5-RV meant to decrease clinician burden. The SCID-5-CV assesses the most common mental health diagnoses seen in clinical environments, such as depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. The SCID-5-CV is recommended to diagnose disorders other than personality disorders in clinical, forensic, or assessment settings, as well as in settings where the range of presenting disorders is sufficiently covered by the SCID-5-CV. The administration time for the SCID-5-CV ranges from 30 to 120 min.</para>

There are two options for the SCID-5-CT. First, the SCID-5-CT can be fully customizable to feature various inclusion and exclusion criteria. Second, there are several templates of the SCID-5-CT that assess particular inclusionary mental health diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar I acute mania, bipolar I or II depression, or adult ADHD. An “exclusionary” version of the SCID-5-CV is also available to exclude individuals from clinical trials with certain mental health diagnoses (e. g., substance use disorders, anorexia nervosa).</para>

         </indexterm> according to the categorical classification system in DSM-5. In this assessment, there are ten distinct personality disorders: paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive. The SCID-5-PD also allows for the diagnosis of unspecified personality disorder. Each diagnosis includes a dimensional rating to note whether the personality disorder is “absent,” “sub-threshold,” or “threshold.” The administration time for the SCID-5-PD is 30–120 min. Additionally, the SCID-5-PD comes with a self-report questionnaire, the SCID-5-PDQ, to shorten administration time; this self-report measure can guide clinicians to possible diagnoses.</para>

            <phrase>2021</phrase>

            <primary>fewer</primary>
         </indexterm>. Most of the questions require dichotomous “yes/no” responses, eliminating the need to probe for additional, more descriptive examples. As such, this interview removes some of the burden from the clinician to be an expert in diagnostic interviewing. The QuickSCID-5 follows a modular design that allows the interviewer to select any module that is applicable. The modules include mood episodes and disorders, psychotic symptoms screen, alcohol and other substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adult ADHD, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, screening for other disorders, and rule-out mental disorders due to a medical condition and substance/medication-induced mental disorders. The QuickSCID-5 cannot be used to ascertain a psychotic disorder diagnosis, due to recommendations of avoiding such diagnoses with purely dichotomous yes/no responses.</para>

         </emphasis>) is a semi-structured interview intended for use in adults with suspected anxiety, mood, or obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. The administration time for the DIAMOND ranges from 30 to 90 min. This interview includes questions that assess diagnostic criteria for all disorders in those sections of the DSM-5 and certain diagnoses that commonly co-occur with these diagnostic categories (e. g., autism spectrum disorder, avoidant personality disorder). Similar to the interviews described previously, the DIAMOND follows a modular format, and the selection of modules should be based on presenting problem. In fact, the DIAMOND includes an optional self-report screening to determine which modules would be most appropriate to administer.</para>

            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is a semi-structured interview designed to assess current mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, trauma, and related disorders. This interview also contains screening questions for various disorders that co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders, such as hoarding disorder, impulse control disorders, feeding and eating disorders, dissociative disorders, and psychotic disorders. Additionally, throughout the interview, the interviewer inquires for dimensional ratings of the key features of all possible disorders, regardless of if the diagnosis is being considered. Dimensional ratings of the final diagnosis(es) are also included to measure the degree of distress or impairment the disorder may be causing. One alternative version of the ADIS-5—the ADIS-5 Lifetime (ADIS-5-L)—contains all of the same diagnoses as the ADIS-5 and includes assessment for lifetime diagnoses. This version also collects a diagnostic timeline to determine the time of onset, remission, and sequence of various diagnoses. The primary disadvantage of the ADIS-5 is the administration time; this assessment takes 2–4 h to administer.</para>

      <title>The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-5</title>
      <para role="Para">The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-5 (MINI-5) was developed to assess the disorders considered most important in clinical and research settings. This interview was designed to be brief and broad, requiring 15 min to administer and including symptoms from a variety of DSM-5 diagnoses (Sheehan et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1997</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Each question is dichotomous and allows for yes/no answers. There are several versions of the MINI-5 available, including the MINI-KID, MINI-Screen, and the MINI-Plus. The MINI-KID was developed to assess the 30 most common mental health disorders in children and adolescents aged 6–17 (D. V. Sheehan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The MINI-KID has 24 modules, with separate suicidality modules organized by age group. The parent and child are interviewed together, although all questions are directed toward the child. Parents are asked to only respond if the child provides inaccurate information. To interview parents, the MINI-KID Parent Version would be more appropriate, though it is recommended to use the MINI-KID where possible. The administration time for the MINI-KID can vary between 15 and 50 min. The MINI-Screen and MINI-Plus were developed for use in adults. The MINI-Screen includes only the screening questions from the modules of the MINI-5. The instructions recommend conducting the full module based on positive screens from these questions to gather a more holistic understanding of accurate diagnoses. Lastly, the MINI-Plus is a slightly longer interview that can capture up to 48 disorders, including comorbidities (Pinninti et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <title>The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for DSM-5</title>
      <para role="Para">The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) is a semi-structured interview developed in 1978, modeled after the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and geared toward children and adolescents aged 6–18. This interview has been updated with published revisions of the DSM, with the latest version being the K-SADS for DSM-5 (K-SADS-5; De La Peña et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This interview was designed to help collect information from children, parents, and other collateral sources. Diagnoses are assessed as current (i. e., symptoms present within two months of interview) or lifetime (Kaufman et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1997</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The K-SADS-5 consists of a screening section and six supplements. The screening section briefly assesses for affective and psychotic disorders but also includes other disorders such as feeding and eating disorders. Following the screening section, interviewers are able to choose appropriate supplemental assessments to administer. The six supplements include (1) depressive and bipolar disorders, (2) psychotic disorders, (3) anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorders, (4) disruptive behavior and impulse control disorders, (5) substance use disorders and feeding and eating disorders, and (6) neurodevelopmental disorders. Administration time for this interview can range between 35 and 75 min, depending on the severity of symptom presentation.</para>
