      <para role="Para">Recent studies<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>studies</primary>
         </indexterm> suggested that ED prevalence among African American, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and/or Native American ethnic minority groups is comparable to, <emphasis>or higher than</emphasis>, ED rates among non-Latinx European Americans (Cheng et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although members of ethnic-racial minority groups are not protected from developing an ED, they are less likely to receive a referral for ED assessment or treatment than European Americans (Moreno et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Even when referred for treatment, ethnic and racial minorities are less likely to utilize mental-health resources than their European-American counterparts. The lack of treatment referral and treatment receipt in ethnic-minority groups is theorized to be the result<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>result</primary>
         </indexterm> of increased stigmatization of mental health services (Misra et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Another important consideration is the potential need to include the family in the assessment and treatment process. For example, excluding family members from clinical services could violate the Latinx cultural value of <emphasis>familismo</emphasis>, which refers to a strong identification and attachment to nuclear and<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>and</primary>
         </indexterm> extended families. Finally, therapists should be aware of cultural adaptations and tailor their intake interview to assess culturally relevant issues that may maintain ED behaviors. For example, Exum et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) theorized<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>theorized</primary>
         </indexterm> that for Black women, discrimination, strong black woman identification (cultural and societal expectations of strength), and culturally specific body-image ideals may lead to stress. In turn, ED behaviors may serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism for mitigating the high stress that Black women are exposed to in society.</para>
      <para role="Para">Patients who identify as a member<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>member</primary>
         </indexterm> of an ethnic-racial minority group who appear for services may be more likely to present with a higher level of psychiatric impairment and disorder severity (Burke et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). High severity may be due to cultural stigma and discrimination, which may lead some individuals to live with ED symptoms longer and wait to seek treatment (or not receive appropriate referrals) until they are severely impaired.</para>
      <para role="Para">Despite having greater<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>greater</primary>
         </indexterm> symptom severity upon initial treatment presentation, certain minority groups may simultaneously report lower body-image concerns than their European American counterparts. Researchers suggested that potential differences in body image disturbance may be due to cultural preference for “curvier” body sizes among members of certain ethnic and racial groups (Lowy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). East Asian individuals are likely to prioritize body image based on thinness, and culturally important features, such as eye shape and<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>disturbance</primary>
         </indexterm>due to pressures to achieve competing appearance ideals, weight stigma from multiple sources (e. g., mothers, relatives, and “aunties”), and pressures to possess light skin (Goel et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Finally, for first-generation ethnic-racial minorities, clinicians should evaluate the role of acculturation in the onset and maintenance of ED symptoms.</para>

         <emphasis>Assessment Tip:</emphasis> During assessment and treatment, it is important to consider the cultural practices of the population.

            <primary>Orthodox Jewish religion</primary>
         </indexterm>. Similarly, it is important to parse apart motivations for underlying eating behaviors. For example, Ramadan and Navratri are culturally sanctioned periods of religious fasting. One the one hand, it is not appropriate to pathologize culturally sanctioned eating behaviors. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that weight- and shape-related motivations for dietary restraint can co-exist with religious motivations for fasting. Thus, therapists should not assume that religion is the primary or only reason motivating fasting. We recommend that therapists ask if “any small part” of the behavior is also motivated by the desire to lose weight or compensate for an eating episode. If a client indicates that a secondary motivation of religious fasting or body avoidance is to accommodate the ED, then this provides<indexterm significance="normal">

         EDs<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>EDs</primary>
         </indexterm> are frequently elevated among people with food insecurity (Becker et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture as a condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food (National Research Council, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Food insecurity is disproportionately experienced by people with lower incomes, people from minoritized racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and people who identify as a sexual minority, which may be attributed to factors such as worsened socioeconomic conditions, structural racism, and discrimination. Although the mechanisms linking food insecurity to ED psychopathology are still being evaluated, one theory posits that individuals with food insecurity experience “feast-or-famine” cycles (Dinour et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>), which may drive patterns of dietary restriction and binge eating. According to this model, during<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>during</primary>
         </indexterm> times of lower food availability, some household members may restrict food intake out of necessity or to make food available to other members of the household. When food is more abundant, such as when financial resources become available, people in the feast-or-famine cycle<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>feast-or-famine cycle</primary>
         </indexterm> may be more likely to binge eat. Traditional assessments for EDs have focused on shape/weight-related motivations for dietary restraint, with no current measures specifically assessing food insecurity as a motivation for dietary restraint. It is, thus, important to ask clients if dietary restriction is due (at least in part) to limited food availability. Clinicians should seek to understand how dietary restraint that is motivated by desire to change weight or shape may interact with food insecurity.</para>

Compared to other EDs, men are most likely to be diagnosed with BED and to report overeating. Men are more likely to endorse a desire for a muscular figure, consistent with Western body ideals. To this end, men with EDs may strive to gain muscle mass or have a lean body (with low percent body fat) to enhance the appearance of muscularity.</para>

      <para role="Para">Gender plays<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>plays</primary>
         </indexterm> a critical role in how EDs are experienced. The experience of gender for many people is fluid and better defined as a continuous variable in which a person can identify anywhere along the continuum<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>continuum</primary>
         </indexterm> of “feminine” and “masculine.” We define the term transgender broadly to be inclusive of any person whose gender identity does not match the gender that would correspond with their sex assigned at birth. Transgender individuals are more susceptible to EDs than cisgender individuals. Within the transgender community, 17.7% of individuals have elevated ED symptomatology, and individuals assigned female at birth are especially at risk for developing an ED during their lifetime (Rasmussen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Elevated ED symptoms may also intersect with gender dysphoria in transgender persons. For example, levels of body dissatisfaction<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>dissatisfaction</primary>
         </indexterm>are high among transgender individuals who believe that their body is too feminine (i. e., perception of having too large of breasts, hips, or proportion of body fat as compared to muscle) or too masculine (i. e., perception of having too much muscle mass and an undesired V-shaped torso) (Cusack et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). To influence their body weight or shape in a way that is more personally desirable, transgender individuals may engage in disordered eating and unhealthy exercise that could result in the development of an ED (Mirabella et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Gender-affirming treatments (e. g., hormone therapy, surgical interventions), therefore, may play a critical role in improving ED symptoms, but gender-affirming medical treatments are not sufficient stand-alone ED interventions (Rasmussen et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

Additionally, about 5% reported taking diet pills that were not prescribed by a doctor, vomiting or taking laxatives (4.4%), and/or not eating for 24 h or more (13%; Hudson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">Among Norwegian elite athletes<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>athletes</primary>
         </indexterm>, the estimated prevalence of EDs is up to 32.8%, and rates of EDs are higher in athletes relative to non-athletes, which is consistent with findings from an early meta-analysis (Torstveit et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In the United States, athletes were more likely to screen positive for an ED compared to non-athletes. Some research suggests that not all athletes are equally susceptible to developing an ED. For example, a meta-analytic review of ED psychopathology in female athletes vs. non-athletes found that athletes participating in weight class sports and sports emphasizing thinness/leanness (e. g., rowing, cross country, figure skating, etc.) had higher levels of disordered eating relative to other sport types<indexterm significance="normal">

            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Athletes, especially athletes participating in sports that focus on thinness/leanness may be exposed to additional risk factors that non-athletes or athletes participating in other sports do not encounter; these additional risk factors include: (1) the belief that sport performance is optimal at a lower weight, (2) revealing uniforms, and (3) reinforcement from judges and/or coaches for certain body types. Due to the serious health risks associated with EDs (e. g., irregular heart rate, imbalanced electrolytes, bone deterioration), athletes who continue to participate in their sport with an ED are highly susceptible to physical injury, anemia, chronic fatigue, irregular menstruation (for women), and other serious medical problems due to relative energy deficiency syndrome (or REDs).</para>

However, when patients engage in exercise past the point of their physical capacity, despite sickness or injury, against medical advice, or to compensate for an eating episode, it is unhealthful.
