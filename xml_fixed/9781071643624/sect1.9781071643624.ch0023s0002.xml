   <title>Description of the Population: Healthcare Settings and Population Characteristics</title>
   <para role="Para">There are several healthcare delivery systems in the United States that aim to provide preventative care to help individuals maintain health, provide resources, educate them on treatment options, and deliver treatments when an injury, disease, or illness develops (IOM,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Healthcare systems typically involve the facilities where care is delivered (i. e., hospitals, residential and home care services), long-term care, clinics, and offices, as well as the individuals providing care (i. e., physicians, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists).</para>

A unique feature of emergency care departments is their ability to provide acute medical care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay or demographic characteristics (Fields et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

This chapter highlights how psychologists are critical in short-term care settings. Psychologists facilitate access to mental health treatment, reduce mental health stigma, underscore the impact on health outcomes through psychoeducation of the relationship between physical and mental health on overall health and disease processes, address communication between the healthcare consumer and the healthcare<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> and Department of Veterans Affairs community living centers (CLC) are long-term care facilities. The population characteristics of individuals receiving treatment in this setting tend to range in age, with older adults being the highest consumers due to increased longevity. At the same time, younger individuals diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, disabilities, and chronic medical and psychological conditions make up the fastest-growing segment (Molinari et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Psychologists’ roles in LTC<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>LTC</primary>
         </indexterm> have changed drastically from the past in a limited consultation role. In addition to traditional face-to-face therapy, psychologists engage with the residents’ complete medical records, engage with additional healthcare staff, provide feedback, and make themselves available to the team and caregivers of the residents. In LTC settings, psychological and behavioral problems arise, and a psychologist can also provide an assessment and interventions based on their observations and staff reporting. Tailored behavioral interventions and alternate engagement reduce the reliance on psychotropic medications while promoting the health and well-being of both the<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> may involve minimal primary care on-site. Individuals may still independently care for themselves and receive assistance from community programs to facilitate aging in the home. In some instances, individuals may no longer have access to traditional primary care facilities due to progressing chronic medical conditions, reduced social support networks, and increased burden in traveling to traditional care facilities, as is the case for most rural-dwelling individuals. Individuals in these settings<indexterm significance="normal">

         </emphasis>). Psychologists in these settings encompass the roles in previously mentioned settings, including team-based interaction, in providing wrap-around care to the individual. A unique aspect is the additional data obtained from an in-home visit. During an in-home visit, professionals obtain additional data, observe instances of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and, if appropriate, include the individual’s<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> where functional care is the priority, psychologists may target a specific problem with the patient in more short-term care rather than tending to a comprehensive, longer-term holistic approach. The approach should still be intersectional, incorporating the patient’s identity into conceptualization. For example, in primary care outpatient settings, a patient who is an older adult female may express interest in working on one specific problem, such as diminished energy. The psychologist may ask the patient about their primary source of stress and target the problem from a functional perspective rather than doing a holistic, comprehensive intake, for example, helping a patient identify that sleep is an actionable target problem for diminished energy. The psychologist can introduce a short course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)</primary>
         </indexterm>. During the intake, the clinician may find that the individual needs to have more accurate ideas about sleep and aging, such that older adults naturally sleep less and nap more, which is not necessarily the case. Functionally, the clinician can underscore this as a misperception right<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>right</primary>

            <primary>holistic care</primary>
         </indexterm> is the primary approach, a psychologist may spend more time understanding the patient’s history, current functioning, and needs. Though they may still target specific treatment goals, holistic approaches utilize the biopsychosocial model of care and an intersectional lens more heavily. For example, using the same patient from the paragraph above, the psychologist would conduct a comprehensive intake that, in addition to sleep, may focus on additional behaviors, lifestyle, identity, and medical and mental health history contributing to the diminished energy. While the clinician may be aware that the patient holds misperceptions, they may wait to introduce these concepts until later in treatment, after building rapport and assessing all relevant factors.</para>
