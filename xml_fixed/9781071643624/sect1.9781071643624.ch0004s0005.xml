   <title>Other Psychological History</title>
   <para role="Para">Regardless of a client’s presenting problem, clinicians should inquire about past and current psychological diagnoses, undiagnosed symptoms, and behavioral patterns for differential diagnosis purposes. Screening measures can be used to quickly assess a broad scope of current symptoms, with follow-up inquiry during the interview as needed. At a minimum, clinicians should ask about substance use history, trauma history, psychosis, and safety (i. e., suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, aggressive behavior, and personal safety). The clinician could also ask about a history of the most common psychological patterns, such as sleep difficulties, concentration or memory problems, depression, anxiety, panic, irritability and anger, obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors, impulsivity, change in behavior, and interpersonal difficulties. For every psychological symptom endorsed, the clinician should inquire about onset, duration, intensity, frequency, and functional outcomes. The key to exploring the client’s psychological history is to determine whether current symptoms are the primary concern, or secondary to another problem (e. g., attentional difficulties due to trauma history or substance use).</para>

      <title>Substance Use History</title>
      <para role="Para">Given the high prevalence of substance use in the general population (see Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>), clinicians should always inquire about substance use regardless of diagnostic hypotheses. Further, many DSM disorders include a substance use rule-out because<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>because</primary>
         </indexterm>the side effects of substances often parallel symptoms of the disorder (e. g., elevated heart rate after stimulant use versus somatic symptoms of anxiety; anhedonia with alcohol and cannabis use versus symptoms of depression; cognitive inefficiency or attentional difficulties associated with cannabis use versus ADHD).</para>
      <para role="Para">When screening for substance use, the clinician should obtain information about the date of last use, quantity used,frequency<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>frequency</primary>
         </indexterm>and duration of use, route of administration (oral, nasal/snort, smoke, inject, other), and any negative effects resulting from continued use (e. g., withdrawal, tolerance, functional or social problems, etc.). Questions should be sequenced starting with the less stigmatizing legal drugs (caffeine, tobacco, alcohol) followed by questions about illicit drug use and misuse of prescription drugs. Based on the prevalence of substance use in the general population, taking the stance that a client is using or has used a substance may also result in more accurate responses from the client (e. g., “Tell me about your alcohol use” versus “Do you drink?”). If a client denies using a substance, the clinician should inquire about the client’s reasons for non-use. For example, the interviewer could ask, “What made you decide not to drink?” Structuring the interview in this manner reduces stigma and patterns of embarrassment or defensiveness and increases the likelihood that clients will respond openly.</para>
      <para role="Para">Instead of asking about “illicit” or “street drug” use, the clinician should ask about each substance use category specifically (e. g., opiates, stimulants, etc.). Terminology should also be explained carefully to ensure the client understands the language as intended. For example, when asking about prescription drug use, clients’ knowledge of the term “misuse” may vary based on experience or sociocultural understanding. For screening purposes, the term “misuse” should be defined as taking a prescription medication<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>medication</primary>
         </indexterm>in a way that it needs to be refilled more frequently than ordered, taking medications for purposes other than the way they were prescribed, or taking medications that were not prescribed to the client. Interviewers should also be familiar with commonly used and misused substances. During the evaluation, the interviewer may want to conduct a review of the client’s medical problems and medication list in collaboration with the client, specifically asking about chronic health problems that may result in overuse of medications (e. g., chronic pain) and patterns of use for medications that are commonly misused.</para>

      <title>Trauma History</title>
      <para role="Para">Exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE; e. g., witnessing death, serious accident or injury, life-threatening illness, violent encounters) is common, with over 70% of people experiencing one PTE and over 30% experiencing four or more PTEs in their lifetime (Benjet et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Though most people exposed<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>exposed</primary>
         </indexterm> to a PTE will recover without treatment, approximately 8% go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Koenen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clients with a trauma history often present with co-occurring physical and mental health disorders (e. g., chronic pain and headaches, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, insomnia, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, substance use disorders, and suicidal behaviors).</para>
      <para role="Para">Despite the high prevalence rate and negative impacts of trauma on well-being, many clients do not report traumatic events or associated symptoms to their providers (~58% seek treatment; Koenen et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Because clients may not spontaneously provide information about their trauma history, clinicians should inquire directly, even if PTSD is not one of the diagnostic hypotheses<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>hypotheses</primary>
         </indexterm>. If the client endorses a history of exposure to a PTE, the interviewer should follow up with additional questions to differentiate PTSD from other disorders. For example, symptoms of hyperarousal and avoidance also occur with generalized anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. PTSD can be differentiated from other disorders through the presence of re-experiencing symptoms such as nightmares and flashbacks.</para>
      <para role="Para">When screening for a history of trauma, it is critically important to exercise clinical sensitivity. Interviewers should avoid the use of potentially triggering explicit terms such as “abuse” and “rape, which may carry different meanings<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>meanings</primary>
         </indexterm>for the client than for the interviewer (e. g., forced sexual intercourse or assault by a stranger versus forced sexual intercourse by any other person). For example, a client may not identify an experience as “rape” but may report having been forced to engage in sexual intercourse. Additionally, sociocultural stereotypes and gender norms may influence how people perceive certain traumatic events (e. g., the belief that rape only happens to women). By approaching the interview with clinical sensitivity, interviewers can create a safe, non-judgmental space for clients to share their experiences.</para>

      <title>Safety</title>
      <para role="Para">Suicide is an urgent and growing public health crisis with lasting effects on individuals, families, and communities. Mental health professionals have an ethical obligation and responsibility to protect clients from imminent danger to themselves and others (Simone &amp; Fulero,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>). When conducting a diagnostic interview, regardless of the specific referral question or diagnostic considerations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>considerations</primary>
         </indexterm>, it is incumbent on the clinician to assess for safety, including questions about suicidal thoughts, non-suicidal self-injury, thoughts of harming others, and personal safety. Specific to protecting others, clinicians have a “duty to warn” (Tarasoff I; responsibility to warn potential victims if clients present a serious threat of harm) and a “duty to protect” (Tarasoff II; reasonable steps must be taken to protect potential victims from harm, even if confidentiality is violated). Mental health professionals are responsible for understanding the legal mandates in the jurisdiction where they practice.</para>
      <para role="Para">During a diagnostic interview, the clinician should always assess for safety concerns. This can be done by asking direct questions and utilizing evidence-based screening tools (e. g., Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale; Posner et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). During the interview, one strategy is to ask direct and open-ended questions<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>questions</primary>
         </indexterm>about the client’s current state of mind, including thoughts of suicidal ideation, self-harm, harm to others, and personal safety (e. g., “Have you had thoughts about harming yourself or others,” “Do any of your physical, cognitive, or emotional symptoms ever create situations that are dangerous for you or threatening to others,” “Do you feel safe in your home or other environments?”). In addition to direct questioning, observing non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice can also provide valuable insights. Evaluating the client’s support system, access to weapons or harmful substances, and recent life stressors can help gauge their level of risk.</para>
      <para role="Para">If the client reports safety concerns, it may be necessary to pause or deviate from the initially planned interview and shift focus to a crisis assessment and management. To understand the severity of the safety concern, it is important to evaluate the immediacy and intensity of the expressed thoughts or behaviors, considering factors such as frequency, duration, and level of distress experienced. Additionally, the clinician must inquire about the client’s level of intent, whether they have conceived<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>conceived</primary>
         </indexterm> of or made any plans, and whether they can carry out any harmful actions. Assessing for protective factors, such as supportive relationships, coping skills, and reasons for living, can provide valuable insights into the client’s resilience and potential for safety. It’s essential to consider the context of the individual’s life circumstances, including recent stressors or traumatic events, which may exacerbate their safety concerns. Finally, when assessing safety, it is crucial to establish rapport and trust to encourage honesty and disclosure while being prepared to intervene or refer for immediate help if necessary.</para>

      <title>Delusions and Hallucinations</title>
      <para role="Para">It is good clinical interviewing practice to ask all clients about current and past episodes of psychosis. Psychosis involves disruptions in both the content and process of thought, leading to impairments in a person’s ability to manage the demands of daily life. Delusions are strongly held, false beliefs that are maintained by the client despite evidence to the contrary. Common delusions include themes<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>themes</primary>
         </indexterm>of persecution (e. g., feeling as though they are being harassed, watched, followed, conspired against, etc.), grandiosity (e. g., feeling as though they are more important than others; having special powers), and somatic (e. g., a person of male sex believing they are pregnant; missing or extra body parts). Hallucinations are sensory perceptions of things that are not there. Though hallucinations can occur in any sensory process, auditory hallucinations are the most common<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>common</primary>
         </indexterm>for people with psychiatric concerns and typically align with the content of delusions (when present). For example, a client with persecutory delusions may hear voices expressing derogatory statements toward them. When a client endorses auditory hallucinations, the clinician must inquire about the presence of command hallucinations, which are voices that instruct a person to do something. Because they are less likely to occur independently, clients presenting with visual, smell, taste, or tactile hallucinations may be experiencing the sensation secondary to another problem (e. g., traumatic brain injury, substance intoxication, medical concerns, sleep deprivation, dehydration, etc.; Green,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
