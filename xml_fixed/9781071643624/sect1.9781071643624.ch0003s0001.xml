      </indexterm>. Irrespective of its form, the clinical interview is critical to delivering effective evaluation, intervention, and referral services, and it may be the first or only interaction a provider has with a client.</para>
   <para role="Para">The clinical interview is more than an opportunity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>opportunity</primary>
      </indexterm> to gather information. Some argue that, at its core, the two most important components of a clinical interview are collecting data and building rapport (Pashak &amp; Heron, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Interviewers must obtain information related to the client’s primary issues, including biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors that may influence their presentation, while leveraging an empathetic, compassionate stance to cultivate trust, openness, and honesty. Interweaving these clinical interview objectives is a nuanced, complex, and important skill set. Clinical interviewing is a multi-purpose and useful tool for clinicians. In this chapter<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>chapter</primary>
      </indexterm>, we present several concepts and strategies<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>strategies</primary>
      </indexterm> that support a productive clinical interview. We outline the anatomy of a clinical interview and highlight its possible applications.</para>
   <para role="Para">First, we discuss factors that contribute to the process of effective clinical interviewing. We present empathy and rapport as core interactive components of a clinical interview that have the potential to grow and change throughout the interview and therapeutic process. We review practical and relevant approaches to develop empathy and rapport, highlighting therapeutic assessment as an important concept in clinical interviewing. We also identify vital considerations for building trust and rapport in telehealth clinical interviews, a modality which became ubiquitous during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be frequently used.</para>
   <para role="Para">Second, clinical interviews can be practically implemented for assessment and diagnosis. We review how data collected during clinical interviews can inform case formulation and conceptualization, which are critical components of treatment planning. We also discuss two legacy diagnostic taxonomies, the <emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</emphasis> and the <emphasis>International Classification of Diseases,</emphasis> and we highlight emerging diagnostic frameworks. Diagnostic frameworks can inform<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>inform</primary>
      </indexterm> how an interviewer may choose to conduct a clinical interview. Additionally, we discuss three broad categories of clinical interviews: unstructured, semi-structured, and structured interviews. We present advantages and disadvantages of the different types of interviews and provide guidance about how to choose among these options. Lastly, we provide a summary of several semi-structured and structured clinical interviews that are commonly implemented in clinical settings. We aim for this chapter to be useful to rising and trained clinicians alike by addressing one of the foremost skills in the practice of psychology: the clinical interview.</para>
