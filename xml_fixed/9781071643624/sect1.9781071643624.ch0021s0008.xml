   <para role="Para">Clinicians should spend time warming the child and caregiver up to the interview before beginning.<emphasis>Do</emphasis> spend time developing a visual schedule or reinforcement system that could serve as a motivator for the child to keep them on task. <emphasis>Do</emphasis> build in breaks throughout a long interview to keep the child engaged. <emphasis>Do</emphasis> express empathy and openness to the child and caregiver. While it is the goal of the clinician to use this information to arrive at a diagnosis and plan treatment, the interview process itself can be quite therapeutic for children and caregivers who have been struggling and are able to express themselves in a comfortable environment. Recognizing this allows the clinician to maintain a balance between facilitative skills while also obtaining important information.</para>
