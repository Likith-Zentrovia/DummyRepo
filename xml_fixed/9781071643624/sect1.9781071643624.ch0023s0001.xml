In time, healthcare systems have come to appreciate the role of psychologists and psychology in the transformation to provide patient-centered, holistic care with an intersectional lens. This transformation in thinking is called the biopsychosocial model, which includes integrating the individual’s biological and psychological well-being while considering their social environment. These are efforts to treat the whole person, with the understanding that there are, in fact, strong interactions between a person’s mind, body, and identities, all of which may contribute to and impact the individual’s presenting problem.</para>

Some care delivery systems include inpatient and outpatient hospital settings, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, surgery facilities, community clinics, and home care. A variety of programs are embedded within these settings, including primary care, behavioral medicine, hospice, and palliative care, to name a few. APA’s Guidelines for Psychological Practice in Health Care Delivery Systems (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>) highlights that the role of psychologists within health care delivery systems is crucial within multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams to promote the health and wellness of individuals who receive care in these systems.</para>

Due to the nuances of the healthcare systems and the individuals receiving care, the psychologists’ role extends to working with the individuals receiving care and their families. It also encapsulates triage and crisis management, promoting positive health behavior changes and maintenance, providing consultations to other healthcare professionals, and connecting individuals with additional resources outside the care system.</para>
