   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Andy is a 40-year-old Caucasian man presenting to an outpatient mental health clinic along with his wife Jane. Jane asked to join for the initial portion of the diagnostic assessment and Andy agreed. Andy presented as slightly disheveled, in wrinkled clothes with messy hair. He was noticeably fidgety, repetitively tapping his feet on the floor and shifting in his seat. When asked what brought him into the clinic, Andy spoke quickly and irritably, stating that he is “feeling good” and is frustrated to be “wasting time” at this appointment, but agreed to come in for an assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>assessment</primary>
      </indexterm> given his wife’s insistence. Jane shared that she is concerned that Andy’s mood is “too up,” that he is not getting enough sleep and that some of his ideas do not make sense. She reported that he has had multiple periods like this in the past and that he had been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist before they moved 6 months ago for Andy to start a new job as a graphic designer. Since moving, Andy stated that he did not need to continue treatment as he was feeling happy and motivated by his new position. Jane expressed being worried that Andy’s behaviors may end up costing him his job; she shared that he was placed on disciplinary probation for not submitting work on time and will be fired if his performance does not improve.</para>
   <para role="Para">The clinician thanked Jane for her input and then completed the SCID for DSM-5 with Andy alone. Andy endorsed a history of major depressive episodes beginning at age 20. He described having his “first real high” at 25 upon finishing a graduate program. He had trouble recalling the length of this period but described feeling highly creative, having a decreased need for sleep without feeling fatigued, and having unprotected sex with several strangers which he described as highly unusual for him, particularly as he was in a monogamous relationship at the time. He noted that this subsequently led to his relationship dissolving, which motivated him to see a psychiatrist. He reported being prescribed a mood stabilizer and noted having taken his medication regularly for the past 4 years. However, he chose to not refill his prescription upon moving, given improvements in his mood and his dislike of the medication’s side effects.</para>
   <para role="Para">With regard to his current functioning, Andy reported feeling “super up, but also edgy at the same time” for approximately the past 3 weeks. He endorsed decreased need for sleep (4 h per night versus his typical eight), and increased energy which he has been trying to “burn up” by biking several hours per day, when he previously had not used his bike in over a year. He described an increase in creativity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>creativity</primary>
      </indexterm>, particularly with regard to his work, and noted pulling multiple all-nighters drafting out plans to revamp the company’s overall vision and mission. He stated feeling “unstoppable…my ideas are flowing so much faster,” and reported with confidence that he will be promoted to head of the design department within the next month as he has “the most valuable mind in the company by far.” The clinician noted that he became tangential in his thinking at several times during the interview and needed to be redirected. He denied any current recreational or prescription drug use and did not report having any medical conditions. The clinician assessed for risk and Andy denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. Given the duration of Andy’s abnormally elevated and irritable mood, in combination with his heightened energy, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, and increased goal-directed activity, as well as the significant impairment these behaviors have had on his work functioning, Andy meets criteria for a current manic episode and therefore, bipolar I disorder.</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Lisa is a 25-year-old Hispanic female who reported experiencing depressed mood on a health history intake form administered at her initial primary care appointment at a community health center. She presented as withdrawn, with poor eye contact and slowed, quiet speech. Her primary care doctor recommended that she be evaluated by the center’s behavioral health clinic and Lisa agreed. She met with a prescribing clinician who completed a brief unstructured diagnostic interview confirming that Lisa met the criteria for major depressive disorder. Lisa described a history of experiencing periods of persistent low mood in which she had decreased appetite, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and anhedonia. These episodes typically lasted about 1 month and began in her teenage years. She described herself as always being a “moody person” but noted<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>noted</primary>
      </indexterm> that the periods have gotten worse in the past several years; she was having trouble getting out of bed, was skipping more of her college courses, and was often late to her part-time job. These difficulties were further exacerbated by symptoms of anxiety, particularly in social situations. While she noted always being introverted and having a small circle of friends, she reported becoming increasingly withdrawn from others and turning down social plans. Lisa declined psychotherapy services, explaining that her busy schedule made it too difficult to commit to sessions, but was amenable to initiating an SSRI to treat her symptoms of depression and anxiety.</para>
   <para role="Para">Several months later Lisa returned to the clinic for a follow-up appointment to monitor her response to the medication. Lisa’s affect was noticeably brighter and she met the clinician with a smile. When the clinician noted this change, Lisa agreed that she had been feeling “really bubbly” for the past several weeks. She described striking up conversations with classmates she had never talked to before and reported joining five clubs on campus, spanning a wide range of activities that she had no prior experience in. She reported that waking up, going to school, and working at her part-time job felt easy and that she was no longer tired at the end of the day; she also noted sleeping 2 h less than usual and feeling even more rested upon waking. Lisa spoke very quickly and was noticeably<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>noticeably</primary>
      </indexterm> talkative; when the clinician mentioned this, Lisa agreed, stating that her mother had made the same comment and that her thoughts felt “fast and hard to keep track of.” She went on to say that she and her mother got in a small fight last weekend over a lewd joke Lisa made at a family dinner that Lisa’s mother found to be inappropriate and uncharacteristic of her. Lisa denied any current substance use. The clinician had Lisa complete the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) and she screened positive for hypomania. The clinician then administered the bipolar disorder module of the SCID for DSM-5. This interview confirmed that she met the criteria for a hypomanic episode given her persistently elevated mood, talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, and decreased need for sleep, all of which were uncharacteristic of her and noticeable by others, but were not causing marked impairment. These symptoms were deemed to extend beyond the physiological effects of her antidepressant medication. Lisa endorsed having experienced several similar periods of lesser intensity about 1 year ago that lasted at most 2 days. She agreed that this was the longest and most intense period of elevated mood she has experienced. Given her history of major depressive episodes and current hypomanic episode, Lisa therefore meets the criteria for bipolar II disorder. While Lisa was hesitant to discontinue her antidepressant medication at first, explaining that she had never felt better, she ultimately agreed with her clinician that her behaviors were negatively affecting her relationships with others and her ability to focus on her schoolwork. They subsequently explored alternative treatment options.</para>
