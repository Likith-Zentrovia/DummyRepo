      </indexterm> underscore that suicide risk assessments are simply formulations of relative risk at one given point. Clinicians cannot predict future behavior, given behaviors’—especially suicidal thoughts and behaviors—instability over time (Kleiman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Chu et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">

         <primary>warn</primary>
      </indexterm>against rigid classifications (e. g., labeling individuals low, moderate, and severe risk). Rather, they recommend taking a flexible approach and staying open to the dynamic nature of suicidality.</para>
   <para role="Para">Firstly, clinicians should aim to delineate where their patient’s suicide risk falls on the suicidality ideation to action spectrum. Suicidal ideation is often defined as thoughts of ending one’s life without the presence of any intention to act on said thoughts. Instead, suicidal intent reflects that one is in a suicidal crisis state or at a heightened risk of fatally injuring themselves. This is differentiated from lethality, or one’s tendency to select more fatal methods (e. g., firearms), since method planning could be less about one’s combined desire and intention to die and instead be greatly influenced<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>influenced</primary>
      </indexterm>by accessibility. Access to lethal means and planning both have a role to play in demonstrating one’s suicide risk—making them important variables to prioritize discussing within risk assessments. Usually, when patients report making plans and preparatory behaviors, they can be deemed higher on the suicide risk spectrum. Furthermore, it is vital to establish patient’s lifetime history of suicidal thoughts<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>suicidal thoughts</primary>
      </indexterm>, behaviors (including non-suicidal self-injury), and attempts. The frequency and duration of lifetime suicidality is a predictor of future suicide attempt risk (Horwitz et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">During formal assessments, clinicians should be mindful of and actively consider suicidality precipitants and risk factors given their potential influence over future suicidal thoughts<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>suicidal thoughts</primary>
      </indexterm> and behavior occurrences. Common precipitants and stressors include but are not limited to one’s level of hopelessness<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>hopelessness</primary>
      </indexterm>, psychological pain, stress, agitation, irritability, impulsivity, affectivity, rumination, exposure to trauma, and sleep difficulties. Higher suicide risk can result from sociocultural intersectionality, particularly those identifying as gender diverse, racial minorities, and individuals with disabilities (Cramer et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The Choi et al.’ (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>) study discussed above also provides a thorough overview of differential risk factors throughout the lifespan. Regardless of age, about half of the decedents within NVDRS data had mental health disorders. Depression was the most prevalent disorder followed by alcohol and substance use. The youngest age group (18–24-year-olds) of decedents had more reports of interpersonal problems.</para>
   <para role="Para">The mid age group (25–44)<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> the highest reports of financial, employment, housing, and legal precipitating factors. For elderly populations, almost 50% of those who died by suicide had reports of physical health problems. The second leading stressor common to the 65+ age group was the death of a family<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>family</primary>
      </indexterm>member. Eades et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>) also explored risk factors of suicidal ideation in those 60+ age group, specifically investigating personality’s influence on individual’s reported suicidality and common risk factors. Overall, two personality models—the Five Factor Model and the DSM’s Personality Disorder traits—significantly explained participants’ varied levels of suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness. Given this significant finding, the authors suggest automatically assessing for suicide<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>suicide</primary>
      </indexterm> risk in adults with specific personality traits. Regardless, we argue that given the high risk associated with suicidality across diagnoses, all individuals regardless of referral concern should be automatically assessed for suicide risk in mental healthcare settings. Structured and semi-structured assessments that allow eclectic but thorough discussions of current and past experiences of suicidality as well as potential risk factors and stressors are imperative for<indexterm significance="normal">
