   <title>Recommendations for Formal Assessment</title>
   <para role="Para">The first step in comprehensive assessment of depressive disorders is integrating screening into clinical, primary care, research, and other social services settings (US Preventive Services Task Force,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). By reaching as many individuals as possible with screening, more comprehensive assessment can then be provided to those who may benefit from it. It is recommended that a structured clinical interview, supplemented by well-validated and reliable self-report instruments to measure symptom severity, is the best start for assessing depressive disorder diagnoses (Joiner et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). In this manner, both clinician ratings and client reports are adequately considered. In addition, the APA released the third edition of guidelines on psychiatric evaluation in adults, supporting the use of such quantitative assessment tools. They note that while the field has yet to come to a complete consensus on adoption, these tools may help clinicians conduct reliable and thorough assessment of patients’ symptoms, which may then prevent potentially relevant symptoms from being overlooked (Silverman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
