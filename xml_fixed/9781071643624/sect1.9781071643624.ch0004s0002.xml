   <title>Referral Question and Presenting Problem</title>
   <para role="Para">The first stage of the interview is to explore the presenting problem (sometimes called the chief complaint), which involves clarifying the referral question and understanding the client’s reason for seeking an evaluation. At this stage, the clinician should focus on the present effects of the problem. The client’s biopsychosocial history will be collected later in the evaluation process.</para>

      <para role="Para">Clients sometimes come to an interview having already explored their symptoms or problems. They likely have guesses about their symptoms or underlying reasons for seeking an assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>assessment</primary>
         </indexterm>, though they may not tell the clinician directly (i. e., “secret questions”). Common secret question themes include reassurance seeking, hope that a diagnosis will (or will not) be given, fear of the future, concerns about expectations and role changes, and guilt, shame, or loss. Exploring the client’s secret questions also allows the clinician to address the possibility that a client may be disappointed by the evaluation outcomes (e. g., receiving a diagnosis when they hoped results would indicate nothing was wrong). When exploring the client’s secret questions, the clinician should use empathy and clinical skills to acknowledge client concerns, educate, and prime clients for potential outcomes. This approach validates the client’s experiences and helps alleviate fears that the clinician will not truly understand the situation. Knowing the client’s secret questions could facilitate person-centered recommendations that may be better received than general recommendations (see Nelson,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis> for more information on clients’ secret questions). In addition to client’s secret questions, clinicians should be aware that clients may present themselves in a way that confirms their beliefs about the problem. The clinician should listen for cues that the client has researched symptoms and behaviors. Asking directly about what the client thinks is the cause of their problems and if they have any diagnoses in mind can help uncover these types of secret questions.</para>
      <para role="Para">The clinical interview often starts with a simple question, “What brings you here today?” If a clinician does not inquire further, they may miss important information and neglect to interview in a manner that gets at the root of the referral question. The clinician should avoid social questions, such as “How are you today” or “How was your week,” which may lead clients to provide vague generalizations about their well-being. Some targeted questions that could help clarify the referral question include, “What is going on that led you to make this appointment,” “What made you seek the evaluation at this time,” “What are your goals for our meeting today,” and “When this evaluation is done, what do you hope to learn?” The clinician could also adapt the various referral questions from Table<emphasis role="InternalRef">
            <phrase>3.1</phrase>
         </emphasis>to learn more about the client’s motivations for seeking treatment (e. g., “What services are you hoping to access through this evaluation,” “Do you think other things could be contributing to the problem”).</para>
