            <primary>After</primary>
         </indexterm>dropping out of high school at age 16, James worked in construction periodically but struggled to maintain employment due to drug use. James reported injecting heroin daily for over 15 years, with only brief periods of abstinence. In the month prior to entering treatment, James had experienced two near-fatal overdoses resulting in hospitalizations. James believed he would die of an overdose if he continued to inject heroin, which ultimately prompted him to seek treatment.</para>
      <para role="Para">The intake interview took place on James’ fourth day of treatment. At intake, the MINI was administered to assess for SUD and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was administered to determine substance use history and severity, as well as environmental strengths and stressors. Based on this assessment, he met the criteria for a current severe opioid use disorder(OUD)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>(OUD)</primary>
         </indexterm>. James indicated that his opioid use had caused numerous problems, including an inability to maintain employment and stable housing, broken relationships with family and loved ones, incarceration, and health problems including abscesses and hepatitis C infection. He noted that he had entered treatment twice previously, but both times had dropped out of treatment within the first month.</para>
      <para role="Para">The assessment of psychiatric symptoms using the MINI indicated the presence of depressive symptoms, which James indicated began after entering detox. James reported experiencing similar symptoms during periods of withdrawal in the past. The PRISM depression module was added to the assessment battery and a primary depressive episode was ruled out. Although his symptoms started during withdrawal and many overlapped with common symptoms of opioid withdrawal, James’<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>symptoms</primary>
         </indexterm>exceeded the expected effects of opioid withdrawal and, therefore, James met the<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>the</primary>
         </indexterm>criteria for substance-induced depression. James indicated that the depressive symptoms he had experienced during past sobriety attempts had significantly contributed to his return to opioid use, noting that even after the physical symptoms of withdrawal had subsided, he could not “feel right” without opioids.</para>
      <para role="Para">Following review of his diagnostic assessment, a preliminary treatment plan was developed to treat James’ OUD. First, through a consultation with a psychiatrist, it was determined that James would be a good candidate for medication for OUD. The psychiatrist expected that buprenorphine would help alleviate James’ opioid craving and depressive symptoms, which were largely tied to opioid withdrawal. Additionally, James’ treatment included 12 weeks of outpatient behavioral treatment with a licensed clinician to treat his co-occurring opioid use and depression.</para>
      <para role="Para">James continued to take buprenorphine for the following year. His depressive symptoms reduced significantly, and by the end of the 12 weeks of outpatient treatment, he no longer met the criteria for substance-induced MDD.Although<indexterm significance="normal">

James reported no arrests or incarceration, obtained periodic employment, and that he had been living for two months in a recovery community.</para>

      <title>Client 2: Macy</title>
      <para role="Para">Macy is a 34-year-old Black female<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>female</primary>
         </indexterm>who was court-mandated to attend 90 days of treatment at an intensive outpatient SUD treatment center for her opioid use. Prior to treatment, Macy had been working part time as a home health aide. Macy noted that things had been very difficult since her mother died nine months prior. She reported feeling increasing depression and loss of motivation since her mother’s death, and she indicated that she started snorting heroin and smoking marijuana to “find relief” from her emotional pain. Macy was arrested after purchasing heroin and had to attend treatment as a condition of her probation.</para>
      <para role="Para">The intake interview took place on Macy’s third day of treatment. At intake, the MINI and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) were administered. Macy met the criteria for a mild OUD. She indicated that she had been<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>been</primary>
         </indexterm>snorting heroin two to three times per week for the past month, usually when it was given to her by a friend. Macy reported that the heroin helped her escape from her emotional distress, and she endorsed craving it. She also noted that when she obtained heroin, she would spend a great deal of time using it and would use more than intended. She did not report any other impairment caused by opioids, except her arrest. Macy reported that she had been smoking marijuana daily, usually once in the evening, to help her sleep at night. She did not report any impairment due to marijuana use and did not meet the criteria for a cannabis use disorder. The assessment of psychiatric symptoms indicated the presence of recurrent MDD, including a current severe depressive episode that started after Macy’s mother died. Macy reported that she had experienced periods of depression in the past, but that this was her worst episode in memory.</para>
      <para role="Para">A treatment plan was developed<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>developed</primary>
         </indexterm> to treat Macy’s depression and OUD. First, Macy met with a psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressants. The treatment plan also included standard group SUD treatment sessions and attendance at a group focused on coping<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>coping</primary>
         </indexterm> with depression and loss. Macy was referred to a Community Mental Health Center for individual psychotherapy targeting depression. Macy completed her 90-day contract and was reassessed at treatment completion. Her depressive symptoms were reduced significantly, though she still met the criteria for a mild major depressive episode (MDE). Weekly urine drug screens as required by the court system had been negative for all substances. One year later, Macy no longer met the criteria for MDD. She was again using marijuana daily; however, she indicated that she had not used heroin since leaving treatment.</para>

      <title>Summary of Cases</title>
      <para role="Para">These two case illustrations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>illustrations</primary>
         </indexterm>demonstrate the importance of individualized, dimensional assessments that distinguish between primary and substance-induced diagnoses. Although an assessment this thorough is not common in routine clinical practice, these vignettes are meant to illustrate the utility of a more thorough assessment approach. Both James and Macy met the criteria for MDD and OUD. However, a dimensional assessment showed that James had a severe OUD and mild depression induced by withdrawal, while Macy had a mild OUD that was likely a result of her severe primary depression.</para>
      <para role="Para">These differences in diagnosis have important implications for treatment. James’ treatment needed to focus on his opioid use, and thus buprenorphine was an appropriate treatment. As expected, James’ withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms remitted after beginning medication treatment. In contrast, Macy’s treatment needed a more direct focus on depression in addition to substance<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>substance</primary>
         </indexterm> use. The client’s depressive symptoms reduced after she began antidepressant and psychosocial<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>psychosocial</primary>
         </indexterm> treatment, and she achieved long-term abstinence from opioids. By assessing the relationship between the clients’ substance use and co-occurring symptoms, both clients received individualized care targeting their substance use.</para>
      <para role="Para">Lastly, for both clients, assessing impairment and substance use outcomes beyond abstinence was important to understand the treatment’s impact. For example, James continued to use heroin periodically, but still saw improvement in substance-related problems. Macy returned to regular marijuana use after treatment; however, she did not continue to use opioids, which had previously been problematic. An outcomes assessment focusing solely on abstinence would overlook the treatment’s success in resolving the<indexterm significance="normal">
