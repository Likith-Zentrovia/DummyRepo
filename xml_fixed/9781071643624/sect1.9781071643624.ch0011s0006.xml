   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">A diagnosis of OCD requires an individual to meet all four DSM-5-TR criteria (Criteria A through D). The DSM-5-TR also includes specifiers for OCD that indicate the patient’s level of insight and whether the patient’s OCD is tic-related.</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0011s0006s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Criterion A</title>
      <para role="Para">To meet Criterion A<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Criterion A</primary>
         </indexterm>, the individual must demonstrate the presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions are thoughts, images, or impulses that are (a) repeated and persistent (i. e., difficult to get rid of); (b) experienced as unwanted or intrusive (i. e., ego dystonic); and (c) cause anxiety or distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors (whether observable behaviors or mental acts) that the patient feels compelled to perform in response to an obsession, or in accordance with rigid rules. Compulsions are intended to neutralize the obsession, decrease anxiety caused by the obsession, or prevent a feared outcome from occurring. Compulsions are either not realistically related to the outcome or are clearly excessive or out of proportion to the situation.</para>

      <title>Criterion B</title>
      <para role="Para">To meet Criterion B<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Criterion B</primary>
         </indexterm>, the individual’s obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming, cause clinically significant distress, or cause clinically significant functional impairment. The DSM-5-TR defines “time-consuming” as taking more than 1 h a day. It is important that clinicians carefully assess how much total time is spent on obsessions or compulsions per day by asking about both duration <emphasis>and</emphasis>frequency. Some obsessions and compulsions occur briefly (i. e., a few seconds) but frequently throughout the day (i. e., every few minutes), such that all the time may add up to more than the patient initially realizes. Functional impairment is commonly<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>commonly</primary>
         </indexterm>observed in social and occupational settings. In the case of children and adolescents, functional impairment is also seen in school settings. In addition, clinicians should assess for functional impairment in activities of daily living (e. g., hygiene) and impairments to home life (e. g., family conflict).</para>

         Criterion C<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>requires that the individual’s obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g., drug, medication), substance withdrawal, or another medical condition. For example, acute and severe onset of OCD in children has been observed following streptococcal infection. As another example, OCD symptoms may be induced by stimulant medication. If organic causes are suspected, a medical evaluation is recommended.</para>

      <title>Criterion D</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Criterion D<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Criterion D</primary>
         </indexterm>requires that the individual’s disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder. Differential diagnosis is an important part of the diagnostic process. Clinicians should be familiar with how other mental disorders—especially those characterized by avoidant or compulsive behaviors—present similarly to OCD, and how OCD differs from these disorders. For example, a patient with social anxiety disorder may avoid speaking to others out of fear of judgment or check individual’s responses to them excessively, whereas a patient with OCD may avoid speaking to others out of fear of communicating incorrect information that causes harm. A patient with an eating disorder may eat in a ritualistic manner to avoid gaining weight, whereas a patient with OCD may eat in a ritualistic manner to prevent their family members becoming ill. A patient with autism may repeat a motor movement to self-stimulate, whereas a patient with OCD may repeat a movement until it feels “just right.” When assessing potential differential diagnoses, clinicians should pay particular attention to the emotional impact of the obsession (e. g., is it distressing or enjoyable? Is it congruent or incongruent with their beliefs?) and the function of the compulsive behavior (e. g., to provide relief from anxiety, or to achieve another purpose? Is it linked to an obsession?).</para>

      <title>Insight Specifier</title>
      <para role="Para">The DSM-IV used to have only one specifier, “with poor insight.” The DSM-5 added new insight specifiers to reflect the range of insight possible in OCD. An individual with<emphasis>good or fair insight</emphasis> recognizes that their OCD beliefs may not be true. An individual <emphasis>with poor insight</emphasis> thinks their OCD beliefs are probably true. An individual <emphasis>with absent insight/delusional beliefs</emphasis> is fully convinced that their OCD beliefs are true. When assessing for insight, clinicians may ask questions such as, “What do you think would happen if you did not perform the compulsion?”, “How likely is it that the feared outcome would occur?”, “What do other people (in your faith community, in your family, in your friend group) do in this situation, and if it differs from you, how come?”. Aforementioned assessments, such as the BABS, can also be a helpful tool to assess insight.</para>

      <title>Tic-Related Specifier</title>
      <para role="Para">The tic-related specifier<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>tic-related specifier</primary>
         </indexterm>is given if the individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder. The DSM-5 added the tic-related specifier in response to a growing literature showing the link between OCD and tic disorder. Indeed, when defining tic status broadly (i. e., presence of motor and/or vocal tics), over 50% of youth met the criteria for the tic-related specifier. However, youth with tic-related OCD did not differ from youth with non-tic-related OCD in terms of OCD severity, related impairment, comorbidity, or treatment response (Conelea et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therefore, clinicians should be mindful to not make assumptions about a patient on the basis of the tic-related specifier.</para>
