   <title>Interpersonal Process Skills</title>
   <para role="Para">Effective interviewing depends on establishing a trusting, open, and collaborative working relationship with a client, and this requires a clinician to convey empathy and establish positive rapport with the client. Empathy and rapport are not only preconditions of effective assessment data gathering but<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>but</primary>
      </indexterm> they also actually function as common therapeutic factors, along with positive expectancy, goals, and other therapeutic outcomes from a well-conducted interview and assessment process (Wampold, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Empathy and rapport interact to support one another, but, as will become apparent later in this section, empathy may be more foundational to rapport than vice versa. Here, we define the concept of empathy, illustrate its application and importance in interviewing, and describe how it can be facilitated. We then do the same for the concept of rapport. For both empathy and rapport, we integrate conceptual considerations related to cultural competence and telepsychology that have developed in recent years. Although current evidence indicates that assessments provided via synchronous teleconferencing<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>teleconferencing</primary>
      </indexterm> are acceptable to clients and provide valid data (Bistre et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Brown et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>), there are specific considerations for developing empathy and rapport in telepsychology settings (Baier &amp; Danzo, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0003s0002s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Empathy</title>
      <para role="Para">Although there is no universally accepted single definition, empathy is generally defined as the accurate understanding and acknowledgement of another person’s mental experience, from their frame of reference (Sinclair et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The ability to achieve empathy with a range of people varies among the general population (Banissy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>), but a natural affinity for empathy is often a factor<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>factor</primary>
         </indexterm> in why people pursue training and careers that involve clinical interviewing. Empathic ability can be further developed through environmental interactions, practice, and training (Abramson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>), but ultimately in clinical encounters, empathy is an interpersonal process that must be deployed with responsive timing and nuance. This may require a clinician to activate similar mental representations as their client, to exert cognitive control to shift attention away from one’s own perspective, and to activate perspective-taking abilities (Abramson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Evidence indicates that empathy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>empathy</primary>
         </indexterm> consists of two components: cognitive empathy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>cognitive empathy</primary>
         </indexterm> and affective empathy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>affective empathy</primary>
         </indexterm> (Banissy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Cognitive empathy involves using cognitive processes to understand and predict another person’s mental state, including how it would feel to be in their particular situation (Cuff et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). By contrast, affective empathy involves activating an emotional response due to and resonant with another person’s state (Halpern, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2003</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Within a clinical interview, this cognitive-emotional understanding and resonance is an ever-unfolding “dynamic process that involves cognitive and emotional discoveries about others’ experiences” (Main et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>, p. 358). Although clinicians may generally be predisposed to empathize with clients, client actions can, at times, elicit frustration, disgust, and judgment from a clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>clinician</primary>
         </indexterm>, which could impede the clinician’s ability to provide the client empathy (Ahn et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). But why does empathy matter?</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Empathy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Empathy</primary>
         </indexterm> serves several important functions. First, providing empathy establishes that the client is worthy of respect, understanding, and compassion (Barnett &amp; Mann, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This anchors the interview in familiar affiliative human interaction patterns so that the client is more apt to lower defensiveness and increase trust, ultimately fostering clinical rapport. This is important for all clients, and it may be particularly important for clients who have experienced trauma, as part of a trauma-informed approach that explicitly values and supports collaboration and a client’s autonomy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>autonomy</primary>
         </indexterm>, experience, and need to feel safe. Accurate empathy reduces the possibility of an interview being re-traumatizing, as the clinician will cognitively and emotionally perceive and respect a client’s limits. Aside from preventing harm, greater empathy can promote better outcomes from assessment or subsequent treatment (Riess, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>), potentially by reducing clinician biases that would impede good outcomes (Garb, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>), as the clinician more accurately understands the client from a lived experience perspective.</para>
      <para role="Para">Relatedly, when a client receives accurate empathy in a clinical interview, it may itself have therapeutic effects (Finn et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For example, when a client shares their experiences and feels understood by a clinician, it can reduce feelings of isolation and stigmatization while increasing hope and self-understanding (Wampold, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Empathy may also increase client adherence to clinical recommendations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>recommendations</primary>
         </indexterm> (Riess, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). If they feel understood, accepted, and validated, they may be more open to behavioral change (Rogers, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Shapiro et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Further, greater empathy is also associated with reduced medical errors and malpractice claims (Riess, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>) as well as greater professional quality of life for clinicians (Laverdière et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Thus, empathy provides clear benefits for clients and clinicians, if clinicians can develop and activate it.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Empathy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Empathy</primary>
         </indexterm> can be developed and activated through intentional approaches, practices, and attention to facilitators and barriers. One well-articulated model called therapeutic assessment (TA; Finn, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Finn et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) seeks to use interviewing and testing as means of gaining empathic understanding of the client’s challenges, dilemmas, problems, and hopes. In eliciting client information and experiences and reflecting them back (e. g., restatements, paraphrases, summaries, reflections of emotion and meaning; Ivey et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>), the clinician helps the client develop accurate and self-compassionate narratives that include new shared discoveries and understandings. Another model, dialectical behavior therapy, has articulated the concept of phenomenological empathy with strived-for benchmarks of empathic validation (Carson-Wong &amp; Rizvi, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). At a basic level, empathic validation requires being fully present, while the client communicates thoughts, feelings, and needs, and accurately reflecting back what the client has said<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>said</primary>
         </indexterm>. Going a level deeper, empathy involves inferring unspoken thoughts or emotions, recognizing how the person’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are completely understandable based on their background and present circumstances. At the deepest level, empathy involves relating to the client genuinely at a person-to-person level.</para>
      <para role="Para">Empathic understanding can also be facilitated by addressing potential barriers. One potential barrier can be disconnected or disjointed communication. In an in-person interviewing format, this could result from an inability to reach shared understanding of content between a client and interviewer due to sensory-perceptual impairment or a failure to understand the other’s slang, vernacular, or nonverbal cues. In a telepsychology context, shared understandings from fluid dynamic interaction<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>interaction</primary>
         </indexterm>could be blocked by Internet connection disruptions (e. g., screen freezing, buffering) or impeded by the inability to see important nonverbal gestures or expressions, which can necessitate greater expression of empathic statements (Stevens et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Empathy might also be impacted by the presence of others in the client’s environment, if the client might disclose differently<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>differently</primary>
         </indexterm> around them. At the same time, telepsychology often provides an opportunity to observe and interact with the interviewee in their own environment. Being “in” a client’s home (virtually) may provide cues regarding others in their environment, and it may provide more important, intimate information that helps the interviewer fully understand and empathize with the client’s experience. Consider a client sheepishly disclosing a “clutter issue” in a clinic; now consider the same client disclosure in front of background revealing their home as a fire hazard due to severe hoarding behaviors. In essence, visible evidence eliminates distortion or bias that might otherwise emerge from ambiguous or omitted information, facilitating accurate empathy.</para>
      <para role="Para">Biases may promote empathy or impede it. Research indicates that empathy may be more naturally evoked when we interact with those who we perceive as like us, such as being of the same race (Armstrong,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, clinicians are trained to become aware of their biases and are cautioned to avoid premature assumptions of empathy (“I’ve had that happen to me” or “I’ve assessed clients with similar cultural backgrounds”), as confirmation bias can prevent soliciting important information (Weiner &amp; Auster, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Striving for cultural empathy begins with viewing clients as being embedded within cultures and affected by culture-based ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving (Levitt et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Thus, to promote accurate cultural empathy, a clinician may consider using a semi-structured approach such as the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI, described below). Cultural empathy is further developed in an interview through the application of cultural competence, possessed knowledge and skills that enable the interviewer to adapt and work effectively with persons of different cultural backgrounds<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>backgrounds</primary>
         </indexterm>. For example, if a client from a historically oppressed background reports experiences of discrimination, the interviewer responds with empathic emotion and appropriate follow-up conversation so that the client feels better understood<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>understood</primary>
         </indexterm>. Further, the interviewer empathizes with and avoids pathologizing understandable distrust of institutions based on negative personal encounters, group-based mistreatment, and historically race-and gender-biased psychiatric diagnosis experiences (Garb, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Miller &amp; Peck, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Evidence indicates that identifying as a woman or sexual minority or perceiving low multicultural competence are risk factors for premature termination from psychological services (Anderson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>), suggesting effects of myopic cultural hegemony in clinical encounters. By contrast, culturally competent interviewing emphasizes cultural humility (Pashak &amp; Heron, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>), a modest interpersonal stance that validates the importance of the client’s cultural background and experiences through listening and genuine interest. Validating and empathizing with client disclosures—including selective, appropriate interviewer disclosure—helps clients feel safe and willing to disclose more sensitive information, building understanding and rapport.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0003s0002s02" role="Heading">
      <title>Rapport</title>
      <para role="Para">Within a clinical interview, rapport refers to the development and maintenance of a working relationship that includes positivity, mutual attention and respect, open communication, and collaboration with shared understandings<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>understandings</primary>
         </indexterm>and goals (Gruba-Mc Callister,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Johnston et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Rapport is dynamic (Alison &amp; Alison, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>), and its depth and emotional valence can change with positive or negative interactions (Hall et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Given that feelings of rapport reflect subjective internal states<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>states</primary>
         </indexterm>, research has indicated that self-report measures tend to be more useful in assessing rapport than observational methods (Vallano &amp; Schreiber Compo, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Further, because one partner’s sense of rapport in a dyadic relationship can be different than the other partner’s sense of rapport, it is best to assess and compare the perspectives of both partners. The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath &amp; Greenberg, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1989</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is a commonly used measure that enables this. The client and interviewer can each rate the degree to which there is agreement on overall goals being pursued, the activities being used, and—most pertinent to rapport—the quality of the bond between interviewer and client. Ratings, as well as follow-up discussion of them, can be helpful in understanding how to maintain and/or improve rapport.</para>
      <para role="Para">As with empathy, greater rapport in clinical interviewing has beneficial effects. Positive rapport facilitates openness, which in turn helps with gathering relevant information to support accurate diagnosis,well-informed<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>well-informed</primary>
         </indexterm> case formulation and treatment planning, and client adherence to that plan (Ross, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Likely for these reasons, rapport is one of the most robust predictors of a positive psychotherapy outcome for both in-person and telepsychology services (Aafjes-van Doorn et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Horvath, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2001</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A single mental health consultation can build hope and understanding in a client (Sung et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>) if an interviewer can establish positive rapport.</para>
      <para role="Para">Applying specific, trainable clinical skills can help facilitate rapport-building. For example, interviewers are advised to project a relaxed, interested, nonjudgmental demeanor, use active listening, and to assume a generally open body posture (Ivey et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Morrison, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Rapport can also be effectively developed in in-person or telehealth settings (Davis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Watts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>) by appropriately mirroring<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>mirroring</primary>
         </indexterm> client paralanguage cues, such as tone, volume, pace, and style (Phillip et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and by displaying culturally appropriate nonverbal engagement signals like posture, eye contact, proximal distance, and facial expressivity (Bell et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Light, safe humor may be sparingly used to make an interview more comfortable, but it should not be used<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>used</primary>
         </indexterm> to avoid important challenging topics or feelings (Ledley &amp; Rauch, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Sattler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). All of these skills should be tailored to the available timeframe and setting.</para>
      <para role="Para">Developing rapport in tele-psychotherapy settings necessitates unique considerations. For example, an interviewer may attempt humor, but it may not connect the same way it would in-person (Mc Cord et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Reese &amp; Chapman, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>), given the potential for streaming lags or lower audio-visual fidelity to transmit subtleties of facial expression or vocal tone. Body posture or gestures may be less visible<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>visible</primary>
         </indexterm>, so clinicians may need to amplify their expressiveness through visible channels but without being inauthentic. In virtual interviews, relationship building may feel more remote, feel less vital, suffer from “Zoom fatigue,” and require more energy (Mc Coyd et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Lastly, keep in mind that the client may feel more self-conscious if their screen includes a picture-in-picture (PiP) showing their face. This could influence their responses and affect rapport. The clinician should try to be attuned to the client’s comfort, and they might help the client turn off PiP if it might decrease discomfort and distraction.</para>
      <para role="Para">Framing and conducting the interview collaboratively also helps build rapport. After brief introductory “small talk,” the interviewer should help prepare the interviewee for what is to come. Expanding from the informed consent process, the interviewer should facilitate discussion of procedures, client expectations, and collaborative goals and context for the interview (Morrison,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This could be especially<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>especially</primary>
         </indexterm> important if a client assumes that their goals will be ignored or will compete with the interviewer’s. One collaborative rapport-building strategy is to liken the interview encounter to a detective<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>detective</primary>
         </indexterm> enlisting the interviewee’s help in understanding a mystery, where discoveries will be mutually beneficial (Segal et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In line with this, the therapeutic assessment approach (Finn, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Finn et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) recommends engaging clients in discussing the referral question, asking what concerns they might have about themselves or their situation, and what they would like to learn from the interview. Curiosity can decrease defensiveness and mitigate unhelpful negative emotions in interviews like fear, shame, apprehension (Kashdan &amp; Roberts, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The interviewer can further demonstrate mutuality through occasional, appropriate disclosure of their own thinking process or by supportive communication, such as expressing that a clinical interview can be a vulnerable experience and that the client is showing courage and trust by engaging.</para>
      <para role="Para">In a circumstance where a structured interview<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>interview</primary>
         </indexterm> or testing is embedded in a broader assessment, a clinician operating from a therapeutic assessment (TA) mindset would describe basic characteristics of the assessment, explain the relevance of assessment questions, and encourage the client to voice any reflections after completing the assessments. The TA-minded interviewer then ensures that the review of assessment results speaks to the questions the client was interested in at the outset of the interview and delivers any potentially uncomfortable results with empathy and modesty. The interviewer would also elicit the client’s thoughts about assessment results and ask for consistent or contrary life examples to arrive at valid assessment interpretations a client can integrate into their life and self-narratives. This is particularly helpful in working with people of diverse cultural backgrounds (see Strand &amp; Bäärnhielm, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis> for discussion on integrating<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>integrating</primary>
         </indexterm> and adapting the CFI with a TA-focus). Further, they invite the client to interrupt with questions or comments, to agree, or to disagree. All these actions support positive rapport in that the client experiences respect, empowerment, and efficacy in their participation, rather than feeling like a clinical specimen<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>specimen</primary>
         </indexterm>. Further, a collaborative approach increases a client’s sense of safety and trust, which are broadly helpful to rapport-building and specifically indicated for “trauma-informed” interviewing. Given the high proportions of those presenting to health care settings with a history of trauma and/or posttraumatic stress symptoms (Benjet et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Greene et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>), interviews should be trauma-informed by default. By doing so, and by following other rapport-building practices reviewed above, interviews will be more pleasant, motivating, and useful for clients, and they will better inform clinicians’ case formulations.</para>
