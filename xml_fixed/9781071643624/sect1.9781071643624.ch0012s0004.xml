   <title>Case Illustrations</title>
   <para role="Para">Two vignettes are provided below to illustrate the broad spectrum in which symptoms of trauma-based disorders preside. The first vignette features Jim, a Marine combat veteran who experiences distress following engaging in several ground combat situations during his military service. The second case vignette is of Dayna, who is experiencing prolonged grief following the loss of her partner a year and a half ago because of unexpected COVID-19 complications. When reading these vignettes, the reader is encouraged to identify cultural considerations such as age, gender, race, family, and socioeconomic status that can affect symptom presentation. While Jim and Dayna’s symptom presentations are vastly different, they both encounter common challenges when processing their respective traumas<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> who lives with his wife Greta and their 3-year-old daughter. Jim has 12 years of education, as he dropped out of college to join the Marines. The family is living with Jim’s parents for financial reasons. Jim is currently unemployed. Six months ago, he lost his job as a carpenter for a construction company. He decided to attend therapy because his marriage was falling apart, and his wife was threatening to leave if he did not get help. The first session with his clinician was held with both Jim and Greta. During that session, Greta stated she was willing to stay in the marriage only if Jim agreed to receive ongoing mental health treatment. She described Jim as a “happy-go-lucky kind of guy in the past…, but now I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.” She also stated that unless Jim got help and changed his behavior, she would leave the marriage and take custody of their daughter. Greta added that Jim became increasingly angry and easily provoked from a “relatively calm and patient” person to one who lashed out “over nothing and anything.” She reported that Jim’s irritability and anger cost him his job.</para>
   <para role="Para">After the first session, Jim attended the following three sessions alone. The clinician learns Jim enlisted in the Marines at age 22, served for 6 years, and was deployed four times to Iraq. He shares that he engaged in multiple gunfire exchange battles during which several of his platoon service members were killed. On his last tour in Iraq, Jim was injured in an IED explosion. The Veterans Affairs recognized him to have 60% service-connected physical disability on account of permanent damage to his back and shoulders. Jim describes ongoing difficulty with his sleep manifested through waking up multiple times during the night. When pressed, Jim shares a recurring nightmare he has, where he is about to be shot by an enemy combatant from a close range. This recurring nightmare frequently interrupts Jim’s sleep as he wakes up with cold sweat and heart palpitations. Jim admits to being reluctant to talk about his experiences in Iraq with anyone,stating<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>stating</primary>
      </indexterm>, “It’s not going to do me any good... I have to be strong for my family and just move on... that is what a man supposed to do.” Jim is also frustrated about his “short fuse” with other people, including colleagues and family members, and discloses feeling guilty and ashamed of his behavior and anger outbursts in the aftermath: “But I don’t know how to stop it…I go from 0 to a-100 in about 2 s.” Jim also describes frustration when driving and engaging in “road rage” situations in the past over “assholes that shouldn’t be driving.” Because of his anger outbursts and feeling increasingly uncomfortable in social situations, Jim avoids going out and prefers to stay home. He also prefers to stay home as he is often “super-alert” in big social gatherings and experiences physical anxiety. Toward the end of the third session, Jim briefly adds that while at home, he enjoys drinking “my six-pack,” referring to beer, and playing video games.</para>

Dayna has completed 18 years of education, has a graduate degree in architecture, and works independently as an architect. She owns a three-bedroom apartment located in the heart of a busy city. Dayna and Angela met in college and lived together for 26 years until Angela’s passing. In the first session with her new therapist, Dayna states, “I’m giving myself a year to get better…If I continue feeling the way that I do now, then I plan to end my life…there’s no point in me living this way.”</para>
   <para role="Para">When asked about what she experiences, Dayna describes feeling “always heartbroken…thinking of Angela and how she died, and what it would have been like if she was here with me now.” When describing Angela, Dayna mentions, “She was my everything.” Dayna becomes visibly upset, at times teary and crying, when talking about Angela and the unforeseen circumstances that led to her passing. She describes keeping Angela’s “side of the closet as it was…untouched.” She shares that often during work, she opens photo files on her computer and looks at photos of Angela “for hours on end.” She explains that looking at the pictures “brings back memories” and makes her feel “a little better…but then I remember Angela is not here and I just can’t believe it.” When asked about activities that provide some pleasure, Dayna notes, “Not much. I don’t have much patience for anything, and nothing makes me happy at this point because it doesn’t feel the same without Angela.” She is now going out with friends “only if they insist” and “don’t feel much of anything there… not interested in meeting anyone new.” She often spends a brief time at these events and heads back to her apartment.</para>

      <title>Comment on Cases</title>
      <para role="Para">Both Jim and Dayna experienced an unexpected traumatic event: Jim in the form of risk to his own life, as well as the unexpected death of a service member in combat, and Dayna in the form of the unexpected death of her wife. Although both experienced a Criterion A event of PTSD, each person’s additional experiences are vastly different and, therefore, can draw a potentially different diagnosis. Jim’s experiences focus on intrusive thoughts in the form of nightmares, changes in mood and cognition in the form of guilt and shame, and hypervigilance in the form of anger outbursts. Jim’s use of alcohol may also suggest a comorbid diagnosis of alcohol use, a condition that is often correlated with PTSD and indicative of avoidant behavior. The symptoms that Dayna experiences are primarily reflective of enduring grief around the loss of a person, from frequently thinking of her late wife to engaging in activities that trigger memories (e. g., looking at photos) or maintaining<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>maintaining</primary>
         </indexterm> her clothes in the closet—these behaviors indicating avoidance and denial of her wife’s passing. Suicidal ideation or wishing to be dead should also be considered as a comorbid condition resulting from the traumatic experience and as a way of coping with the suffering.</para>
