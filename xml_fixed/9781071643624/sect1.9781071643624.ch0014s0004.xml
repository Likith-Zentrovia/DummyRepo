   <title>Case Illustrations</title>
   <para role="Para">The recommended diagnostic procedure for the following two cases of SSRD requires three sessions to assess the patient. If this number of sessions is not available to clinicians who would like to follow our case presentations, we recommend conducting a clinical interview, providing self-report questionnaires to the patient prior to the first session, and gaining patients’ consent to contact their primary care provider (PCP).</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Sabrina is 45-year-old woman<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>woman</primary>
      </indexterm> who worked as a receptionist in a large company. She quit her job a couple of years ago and has lived from disability benefits since then. According to Sabrina, the pain spreading across her body has existed for more than 7 years and has become unbearable. She feels very frustrated after her enormous but unsuccessful efforts to gain control over her pain. Sabrina gave consent to contact her PCP as well as her pain physician. Both doctors confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, a series of different diagnostic and treatment procedures Sabrina has undergone and that she has changed her healthcare providers several times.</para>
   <para role="Para">Sabrina was asked to complete the DIAMOND<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> Self Report Screener before her first session with us and affirmed the screening questions on a depressive episode, substance use disorders, and SSD. During the<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>the</primary>
      </indexterm> first two sessions, we conducted the corresponding sections of the DIAMOND with Sabrina. The interview confirmed that she meets all criteria of SSD. Sabrina reported various especially future-related worries. Sabrina reported emotions of anxiety, deep sadness, helplessness, and desperation, but also anger about her pain. Sabrina experiences the severe impact of the pain on numerous domains of her life. The DIAMOND<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>DIAMOND</primary>
      </indexterm> confirmed that Sabrina meets the criteria of an episode of severe depression lasting for about 12 months and associated with occasional suicidal ideation. The suicidal risk assessment was conducted by applying the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Conducting the substance use disorder section of the DIAMOND reveals Sabrina’s abuse of opioids. By asking Sabrina additional questions (see Table <emphasis role="InternalRef">
         <phrase>12.1</phrase>
      </emphasis>), we<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>we</primary>
      </indexterm> learned about her biomedical model of her persistent symptoms and low expectations regarding psychological interventions.</para>
   <para role="Para">We asked Sabrina to complete four brief self-report scales, which were evaluated together with her in the second session. The Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale confirmed the severity of psychological symptoms of the SSD. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia revealed her avoidance behaviors in various domains of her everyday life. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale provided more insight into her disturbing thoughts associated with her symptoms. The Patients’ Endorsement of the Biopsychosocial Model of Chronic Pain Scale confirmed the clinician’s assumption that psychoeducation and cognitive reappraisal of the patient’s pain perceptions<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>perceptions</primary>
      </indexterm>would be an important component of the treatment plan. After the second session, Sabrina was invited to complete a symptom diary (e. g., Fig.<emphasis role="InternalRef">
         <link linkend="ch0014s0003fg03">12.3</link>
      </emphasis>) over the upcoming 7 days. Through the diary, she observed that distressing events (e. g., emotionally distressing call with her healthcare insurance) can increase the severity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>severity</primary>
      </indexterm> of her pain symptoms substantially.</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Jeff is a 35-year-old male<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>male</primary>
      </indexterm> engineer working for an international company. He often travels abroad for his work. After the last travel to an African country 1 year ago, Jeff returned with a bacterial infection of his bowel and suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms over a week. His PCP treated him successfully with antibiotics. Jeff felt very distressed by this infection and about future international travel. In the meantime, he developed persistent anxieties that he, for sure, suffers from a very rare form of bowel infection that is currently asymptomatic but could break out again in the future and that cannot be treated with common antibiotics. Every little change of his stool and gastrointestinal habits confuses Jeff and causes him to urgently and persistently seek advice from his PCP. He has changed his PCP several times over the past<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>past</primary>
      </indexterm>year because he<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>he</primary>
      </indexterm> cannot trust that the doctor has checked his condition sufficiently. He is worried about his future in the company he is working for, given that he has refused any further job-related travel since last year. Jeff started to restrict his diet and to be very selective about the places he eats food from. This also implies that he withdrew from several of his social contacts.</para>
   <para role="Para">Conducting the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders in the first and second session showed that Jeff meets the criteria of an IAD but no other mental health disorder. With his consent, we contacted his current PCP and gained access to Jeff’s medical file, which confirmed 35<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>consultations</primary>
      </indexterm> with 10 different PCPs and gastroenterologists over the past year. After the first session, we asked Jeff to complete the Short Health Anxiety Inventory as well as the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21. Jeff showed increased scores on the health anxiety scale of the SHAI as well as increased beliefs of negative consequences of becoming ill, which is important information for later treatment planning, especially cognitive interventions. Although Jeff does<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>does</primary>
      </indexterm> not meet criteria of depression, his score on the depression scale of the DASS-21 was in the moderate range.</para>
   <para role="Para">Jeff lives together with his partner John. We invited John to the third session with Jeff’s consent. John appeared to be very worried about Jeff’s anxieties and how they restrict his life. John also mentioned that<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>that</primary>
      </indexterm>communication with Jeff has become challenging. Jeff tries to seek reassurance from his partner. If John declines to provide this reassurance, Jeff often reacts with distance and expresses that he does not feel taken seriously. We asked Jeff to complete a diary on his health anxieties over the 7 days between the second and third session. We created this diary on our own and asked about the triggers of the health anxiety, anxiety intensity (scale 0–100%), unhelpful thoughts, and how much the patient believes in them (scale 0–100%) and focuses<indexterm significance="normal">
