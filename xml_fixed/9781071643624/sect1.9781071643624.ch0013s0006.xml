            <para role="Para">Don’t avoid assessing for trauma exposure and dissociation due to concerns that it will be uncomfortable for client or worry that inquiries may lead to the development of “false memories.” If questions are asked in a nonleading, respectful manner, with attention to client’s ability to tolerate the discussion, information that is crucial to diagnosis and treatment planning is generally attained. Simply asking about trauma exposure in a nonleading manner does not create false memories of trauma.</para>

         <listitem>
            <para role="Para">Don’t worry about “hurting” a client with dissociation by asking about their symptomatic or traumatic experiences. If people learned to dissociate to survive trauma, they have survived worse things than discussing their symptoms. Of course, be mindful of clients’ ability to tolerate discussion if they seem overwhelmed. Go for the “headlines” of the story, rather than specifics. Take breaks, and use grounding and relaxation as needed.</para>
