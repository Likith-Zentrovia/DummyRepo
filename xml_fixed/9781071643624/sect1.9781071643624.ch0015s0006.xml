Note: <emphasis>OBE</emphasis> objective binge eating, <emphasis>ICB</emphasis> inappropriate compensatory behavior. <superscript>1</superscript>OBEs and/or purging behaviors are important to consider as the presence of either OBEs or purging behaviors is necessary for the diagnosis of the binge-eating/purging subtype of anorexia nervosa. <superscript>2</superscript>The size of the binge-eating episodes is crucial to diagnosis. The presence of subjective binge eating episodes (SBEs) in the absence of OBEs would indicate a diagnosis of purging disorder [or another “other specified feeding or ED” (OSFED)]. <superscript>3</superscript>A diagnosis of bulimia nervosa requires the individual to engage in OBEs and<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>and</primary>
         </indexterm>ICBs at least once a week, on average, for a duration of 3 months (i. e., at least 12 OBEs and 12 ICBs in a 3-month period). A diagnosis of OSFED (bulimia nervosa of low frequency and/or limited duration) can be considered for persons who engage in OBEs and/or ICBs less frequently.<superscript>4</superscript>A diagnosis of bulimia nervosa requires the individual to be at or above a normal body weight; a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or OSFED should be considered for individuals who are at a low body weight. <superscript>5</superscript>A diagnosis of binge ED requires the individual to be at or above a normal body weight. The diagnosis does not require the individual to be overweight or obese, although overweight and obesity can be associated with binge ED. <superscript>6</superscript>It is important to consider the amount of food consumed during an episode of restricting. Some persons may report restricting yet consume an amount of food that would not be small enough to be considered restricting. It is also important to consider duration of the restricting episode, which should<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>should</primary>
         </indexterm>be considered alongside the amount of food consumed during the restricting episode (e. g., not eating anything for 8 h vs. eating very small amounts of food throughout the day)</title>
