      <title>Specific Phobia</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Specific phobia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Specific phobia</primary>
         </indexterm>is defined as “marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e. g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood)” (American Psychiatric Association (APA),<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>, p. 225). The specific object or situation that evokes the fear responses is the controlling stimulus. The diagnosis includes categorization of the controlling stimuli into one of five subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, situational, or other type. Greater specification of the boundaries of the controlling stimuli (i. e., the stimuli that are necessary and sufficient to trigger the problematic response) is highly desirable and ultimately is necessary for treatment planning using exposure-based treatments. For example, fear responses might be evoked by any dog, by specific types or breeds of dogs, or by dogs in certain settings or under certain circumstances (e. g., unaccompanied dogs off the leash).</para>
      <para role="Para">Diagnosis of a specific phobia requires the phobic object or situation to almost always trigger an immediate fear response that is “out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context” (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>, p. 225). In addition to fear and anxiety<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>anxiety</primary>
         </indexterm>, the reflex-like response can also include full or limited-symptom panic attacks that are situation-bound. In some cases when the problematic response is triggered by blood-related stimuli (i. e., when the controlling stimulus or antecedent is the sight of blood, hypodermic needles, injuries, etc.), the response might be better characterized as involving syncope or presyncope sensations, such as a drop in blood pressure, feelings of nausea and lightheadedness, and/or fainting. There is some evidence that disgust might be activated as part of some, perhaps all, fear responses found in anxiety disorders (Woody &amp; Teachman,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Specific phobia typically involves avoidance and escape behaviors that are overt and easily identified. Although identification of safety behavior is not essential for diagnosis, it is usually important for effective treatment planning<indexterm significance="normal">

      <title>Panic Disorder</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Panic disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Panic disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> is distinct from the diagnosis of panic attacks. Panic attacks (defined above) are relatively discrete experiences. They are common among individuals with anxiety disorders and not uncommon among individuals with other disorders and those who do not meet the criteria for any disorder (Norton et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1992</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Assessment of panic attacks is necessary to determine the appropriateness of panic disorder.</para>
      <para role="Para">In panic disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>panic disorder</primary>
         </indexterm>, the first component consists of an interoceptive sensation (e. g., pounding heart, feelings of dizziness, etc. as the controlling stimulus) and a panic attack (as the reflex-like response). Individuals with panic disorder sometimes do not identify the controlling stimulus. The absence of an external controlling stimulus leads the individual to experience their panic attacks as unexpected or “out of the blue” panic attacks. The diagnosis of panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although not essential for DSM diagnosis, preliminary identification of the internal triggering stimulus can be useful for treatment planning. This identification can often be accomplished by asking about the individual’s first panic attack, the first physiological sensation that the individual typically notices during a panic attack, the first sensation that the individual noticed during a recent “bad” panic attack, and/or by listening for the individual’s comments recognizing specific threats. A person might readily acknowledge the threat perception that underlies their fear responses or might dismiss or deny such perceptions in a motivated manner. For example, an individual might report “I noticed my heart was pounding, but it’s not like I thought I was having a heart attack.” In this instance, the individual identifies a racing heart as an early symptom of the panic attack and offers an unsolicited denial that they believed they were having a heart attack. Verbal behaviors, both acknowledgments<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>acknowledgments</primary>
         </indexterm> and motivated denials, provide clues to identify the controlling stimulus. The ultimate identification of the controlling stimuli takes place during exposure to physiological sensations during the interoceptive exercises of exposure therapy.</para>
      <para role="Para">The second component in panic disorder includes problematic avoidance behaviors, such as monitoring, checking, and reassurance seeking. Clients with panic disorder often report checking their heart rate, searching on the internet for information about various symptoms and medical conditions, and overusing medical services (e. g., emergency room visits). Panic disorder often involves<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>involves</primary>
         </indexterm>a number of more subtle in-situation avoidance behaviors (i. e., safety behaviors), such as carrying anxiolytic medications (e. g., benzodiazepines), engaging in relaxation or breathing techniques to reduce sudden anxiety, adopting idiosyncratic postures, or being accompanied by a trusted “safe” person.</para>

      <title>Agoraphobia</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Agoraphobia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Agoraphobia</primary>
         </indexterm> is characterized as the distinct fear of public situations using public transportation; being in enclosed, crowded, or open spaces; or being outside of the home alone (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clients might report a fear of having a panic attack, becoming anxious, having to go to the bathroom, or not being able to escape or receive help in the situation (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The DSM-5-TR conceptualizes agoraphobia as separate and relatively independent from panic disorder. In prior versions of the DSM, agoraphobia and panic disorder were more closely linked. When agoraphobia is present with panic disorder, agoraphobia can usually be thought of as the avoidance (behavior) that is associated with panic attacks. When agoraphobia is present but there are no reports of recent panic attacks, it is important to question the individual about the period during which agoraphobia began; a history (sometimes quite remote) of panic disorder is common. For those occasional cases in which agoraphobia is present and there is no history of panic, a simpler one-component<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>one-component</primary>
         </indexterm>(operant association) model appears appropriate. That simpler model would recognize antecedents (e. g., open spaces such as shopping malls, bridges, highways) and agoraphobic avoidance, the function of which is to avoid harm.</para>

      <title>Social Anxiety Disorder</title>
      <para role="Para">For social anxiety disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>social anxiety disorder</primary>
         </indexterm>, fear responses include fear, anxiety, and full and limited symptom panic attacks, specifically related to the fear of negative evaluations from others during social interactions (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is also not unusual for individuals with social anxiety disorder to describe less acute anxiety experiences, such as those that have a more gradual onset in anticipation of events that are more distal in time (e. g., having to give a presentation 1 week later). For many individuals, the experience is more readily characterized as discomfort, worry, and/or anxiety than as fear. The stimulus controlling the fear response involves a social element, and the individual typically expresses concern about being evaluated or scrutinized.</para>
      <para role="Para">It is important to consider the boundaries of the controlling stimuli. The types of social stimuli that evoke fear responses can vary. For many individuals, most or all social situations evoke a fear response. For some individuals, the fear is evoked by specific classes of situations, such as interacting with a potential dating partner<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>partner</primary>
         </indexterm>, talking with an authority figure, using a public restroom, speaking to a large group, meeting new individuals, etc. For example, an individual might report feeling anxiety when meeting new people but experiencing little or no anxiety when meeting with family members or friends.</para>
      <para role="Para">Social anxiety that is experienced in many social situations is often thought of as shyness (Brook &amp; Willoughby,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Many, but not all, individuals with social anxiety disorder are shy. Some are outgoing and experience fear responses and inhibited behavior only in a limited number of social situations. When the controlling stimulus is highly specific (e. g., using a public restroom when other people are present), it is not unusual for the individual to report relatively low anxiety in other social situations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>situations</primary>
         </indexterm>(e. g., meeting new people, giving presentations to groups). When the stimulus that evokes the fear response (i. e., the controlling stimulus) is limited to social performance situations, the performance-only specifier is used (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Understanding which stimuli evoke anxiety and which do not is also important for treatment planning.</para>
      <para role="Para">It is not unusual for clinical interviews to evoke fear responses in individuals, particularly in those with significant social anxiety. The fear responses can lead to avoidance and escape behaviors, resulting in distorted representations of symptoms and inhibited behavior during the assessment interview. Many individuals with social anxiety can be anxious about other people knowing that they have social anxiety. This phenomenon may be particularly relevant for socially anxious individuals seeking services for a different presenting problem (e. g., another anxiety disorder, low social support,support,<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>support,</primary>
         </indexterm> depression, etc.), expressing less or no concern about social anxiety. Some individuals with social anxiety have avoided thinking of their problem as one of social anxiety because doing so implies, to some degree, a prescription for greater social approach and less social avoidance behaviors. For this reason, social anxiety disorder is likely to be underdiagnosed when it is not identified by the individual seeking services as the presenting problem.</para>
      <para role="Para">Safety behaviors associated with social anxiety disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>social anxiety disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> can be quite idiosyncratic but can be broadly categorized as those that involve withdrawal and those that involve overcompensation. These categories can be called “laying low” and “putting on” (Gier, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Laying low might involve standing motionless during a speech, not speaking during a social encounter, standing apart from others or in the back of a group, avoiding eye contact, constraining the tone of one’s voice, and other behaviors to reduce the degree to which one is noticed. Putting on might involve speaking at a fast pace, smiling inappropriately, pacing or nervously fidgeting while giving a presentation to a group, etc. Sometimes behaving like a clown or rigidly adopting a comical approach can be safety behaviors.</para>
      <para role="Para">One feature of social anxiety disorder is post-event processing. In post-event processing, individuals with social anxiety often repeatedly recall and rehearse or replay the social interaction, emphasizing negative aspects<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>aspects</primary>
         </indexterm> of the encounter. Clinicians should be aware that an individual with social anxiety may engage in post-event processing of the therapy session or assessment which may then increase the risk that they drop out of treatment.</para>

      <title>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</primary>
         </indexterm> might be misdiagnosed because the name of the disorder contributes to a neglect of the cardinal feature of the disorder: worry. The defining feature of GAD is anxiety and worry, worry that is characterized by symptoms of physiological arousal, is experienced as uncontrollable, and occurs more days or not over a period of 6 months or more. People with generalized anxiety disorder invariably agree that they worry too much, that they overthink things, that they spend a lot of time in their heads, that they are a “worrier” or a “worry wart,” and/or that they have always been a worrier. It is not uncommon for GAD to be misdiagnosed in individuals who have experiences of anxiety in which worry is not prominent, but whose experiences do not readily fit with other anxiety disorder categories. If worry is not prominent, the interviewer should consider diagnoses of anxiety disorder, NOS; an adjustment disorder with anxiety or mixed anxiety and depression; or mood disorders.</para>
      <para role="Para">Contemporary models of worry view worry as avoidance behavior (Sibrava &amp; Borkovec,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Information about the first component is usually not apparent, including the controlling stimulus and the reflex-like response that presumably serves as the antecedent in the second component. That is, worry appears to serve an avoidance function, but it is often not clear what the client is avoiding. Many clients report that their worry episodes are preceded by “down time,” periods when there are fewer demands on them, and/or periods when they felt bored. Consistent with that observation<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>observation</primary>
         </indexterm>, some theorists have suggested that worry prevents sudden changes in negative affect levels by maintaining a relatively consistent, moderately high level of anxiety, avoiding dramatic shifts in anxiety (Newman &amp; Llera, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Others have proposed that worry distracts the individual from feelings of uncertainty (Koerner &amp; Dugas, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>). We have observed that clients presenting for treatment of severe worry symptoms are often experiencing significant transitions, perhaps triggering existential concerns. The diagnostic criteria for GAD do not make reference to the controlling stimuli (cues and triggers) of worry.</para>
