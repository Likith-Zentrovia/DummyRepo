      Anxiety disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Anxiety disorders</primary>
      </indexterm> are surprisingly common and constitute a substantial portion of traditional outpatient practice (Yang et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>). In addition to being common, anxiety disorders can be quite debilitating, contributing to comorbid conditions (e. g., depression, substance abuse, etc.) and dysfunction in many domains (e. g., marital dissatisfaction, academic and work underperformance, overutilization of medical services, etc.) (Baxter et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Symptoms of these disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>disorders</primary>
      </indexterm> appear to be increasing in prevalence in recent years (Goodwin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>), particularly since the COVID pandemic (Twenge &amp; Joiner, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Anxiety disorders carry an enormous<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>enormous</primary>
      </indexterm> societal cost in the United States and globally (Baxter et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Konnopka &amp; König, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Fortunately, these disorders are relatively recognizable and treatable; there is a strong body of scientific literature to support effective assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders (Higa-Mc Millan et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Van Dis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">The DSM and ICD frameworks upon which current mental health practice relies are typically viewed as atheoretical. However, they are quite compatible with an assessment of fear conditions using the behavioral method of functional assessment. Functional assessment attempts to reveal the function or purpose<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>purpose</primary>
      </indexterm> of the problematic behaviors and symptoms and thereby provides the foundation for behavioral therapy using exposure.</para>
   <para role="Para">Consistent with the view of assessment as potentially therapeutic (Finn,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>), the diagnostic interview is an opportunity to work toward a collaborative understanding of the presenting problem. Diagnosis in the broad sense “goes on in the experience of the client, rather than” only “in the intellect of the clinician” (Rogers, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1965</phrase>
      </emphasis>, p. 223). To the degree that the clinician has and communicates a useful conceptualization of the client’s presenting problem, the client has opportunities to develop an awareness of the factors that maintain the problem and to develop a conceptualization that supports new, adaptive behaviors (Pachankis &amp; Goldfried, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2007</phrase>
      </emphasis>). That conceptualization is implicitly communicated by what the clinician pays attention to and what the clinician asks about. The potentially therapeutic value of the diagnostic interview is increased when the interviewer<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>interviewer</primary>
      </indexterm> is well-versed in a conceptualization of the problem that is useful for bringing about change. For this reason, interviewers are advised to have a facility with the behavioral model underlying exposure-based treatments of anxiety disorders.</para>
   <para role="Para">The behavioral approach offers a clear and compelling conceptualization regarding the functions of anxiety and avoidance and has led to the development of exposure-based treatments that are highly effective (e. g., Deacon &amp; Abramowitz,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2004</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Parker et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Although the DSM and ICD frameworks have been criticized on a number of grounds (Whooley, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>), their compatibility with the behavioral approach makes these categorical diagnostic frameworks quite useful for working with anxiety disorders.</para>

      <title>Behavioral Approach to Assessment</title>
      <para role="Para">The behavioral approach to assessment, called functional assessment, is designed to reveal the function of the problematic responses and behaviors.Anxiety disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Anxiety disorders</primary>
         </indexterm> can be viewed as consisting of two components (Mowrer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1951</phrase>
         </emphasis>): anxiety and avoidance<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>avoidance</primary>
         </indexterm>. The first component, anxiety, is viewed as a Pavlovian (aka classical or respondent) conditioned stimulus-response relationship. Fear responses are reflex-like phenomena that include physiological arousal (e. g., increased breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, etc.) and subjective distress. These responses are similar to other reflexive responses (e. g., salivation, pupil dilation, nausea, etc.) that are under the control of controlling stimuli (e. g., food, light, contamination, etc.). The controlling stimuli<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>controlling stimuli</primary>
         </indexterm>are also called triggers or cues. Through processes such as classical conditioning, a new and different stimulus gains control of the reflex-like response. For Pavlov’s dogs, the pairing of the sound of a bell with food allowed the bell to develop control over the reflex-like response of salivation. Similar processes allow benign stimuli (e. g., the sight of a clown) to develop control of the reflex-like response found in anxiety disorders, i. e., fear responses. Classical conditioning provides a description of one way in which an individual might develop the stimulus-response association that is apparent in anxiety disorders.</para>
      <para role="Para">Fear, anxiety, and panic (i. e., fear responses) are normal, natural, and adaptive behaviors that are biologically based. Some stimuli (e. g., a visual cliff) may reliably lead to fear and anxiety without any prior learning. Other stimuli (e. g., driving a car) that are capable of evoking fear responses appear to have acquired the capacity to trigger fear responses through classical conditioning and secondary conditioning processes (e. g., modeling and informational learning). The function of fear responses is to motivate behavior that keeps the individual safe from harm.</para>
      <para role="Para">The second component of anxiety disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>anxiety disorders</primary>
         </indexterm> consists of avoidance and escape behaviors (Mowrer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1951</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The behavioral perspective views fear responses not only as reflex-like responses that are triggered by controlling stimuli but also as stimuli in their own right. Because fear responses are often experienced as aversive, they motivate avoidance and escape. Behaviors that effectively reduce or prevent fear responses are negatively reinforced, a type of instrumental (aka operant) conditioning. The function of avoidance and escape behavior is that they prevent and/or reduce harm and the associated fear responses. A second consequence of avoidance and escape behaviors is that they inadvertently preclude experiences that can lead to new learning that could offset the stimulus-response associations in memory that underlie the first (respondent) component (Foa &amp; Kozak, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1986</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (i. e., ABC) model underlying functional assessment of the second component (i. e., the instrumental or operant component) views anxiety as the Antecedent (which is also the fear response from the stimulus-response component), avoidance and escape as the Behavior, and anxiety reduction or prevention as the Consequence.</para>
      <para role="Para">In sum, the behavioral perspective views anxiety disorders as involving: (1)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>controlling stimuli</primary>
         </indexterm>, (2) fear responses<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>fear responses</primary>
         </indexterm>, and (3) avoidance and escape behaviors<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>avoidance and escape behaviors</primary>
         </indexterm>. Before describing the nuances of how these three elements are related to each of the anxiety disorders, it will be useful to identify a few terms.</para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="ch0010s0001s02" role="Heading">
      <title>Some Definitions</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Controlling stimuli<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Controlling stimuli</primary>
         </indexterm> include the objects and situations that evoke the fear responses and the subsequent escape and avoidance behaviors. <emphasis>Fear responses</emphasis> include panic attacks, fear, and anxiety. The term <emphasis>panic attack</emphasis> is closely related to the evolutionary concept of the “fight-or-flight” response. Panic attacks are defined in the DSM as consisting of at least four symptoms from a list of 13 possible symptoms. Each of these symptoms can be viewed as facilitating an individual’s capacity to adaptively respond to imminent physical danger, or as a consequence of that adaptive response. For example, an individual might experience “palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate” because increased blood flow provides the major muscles with oxygen and other nutrients needed to engage in vigorous action; “sweating” as part of the body’s anticipation of the increased temperature associated with fighting or fleeing; “paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensation),” and “chills or hot flushes” as by-products of the vasoconstriction associated with diverting blood flow away from body parts that are not essential for fight-or-flight; and so on. The DSM criteria for panic attacks also specify that the symptoms begin abruptly, that is, reaching a peak within 10 min. Viewing panic attacks as activations of the fight-or-flight response is compatible with the view that these physiological processes are normal, natural, reflexive-like responses to stimuli that the client perceives as imminently dangerous.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis>Fear</emphasis> and <emphasis>anxiety</emphasis> describe internal subjective states that involve feelings of distress, accompanied by physiological sensations that are similar to those involved in panic, though typically involving fewer and less severe symptoms. Fear and anxiety can be distinguished from each other because fear is used to describe relatively more acute experiences with an onset that immediately follows the presentation of a stimulus or trigger. Anxiety tends to be used to describe experiences that have a relatively more gradual onset. Fear involves immediate threats, whereas anxiety involves threats that are more distal in time.</para>
      <para role="Para">Individuals can often identify the triggering stimulus and describe the sense of threat underlying their fear response. For example, clients with dog phobias know that they are afraid of dogs and report that they are afraid of being attacked and bitten. In contrast, individuals with anxiety sometimes are less able to identify the triggering stimuli and underlying threat. We assess fear and anxiety based on the individual’s reports of their internal states. Complicating the assessment of fear and anxiety, there is considerable variability in the ways that individuals use these terms and in their awareness and expression of the internal states associated with these terms. That variability is likely related to the individual’s prior learning history regarding awareness and expression of their internal states, including beliefs and expectations shared with others in their cultural groups and families.</para>
      <para role="Para">The term avoidance<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>avoidance</primary>
         </indexterm> is typically used to describe overt, gross motor behaviors that individuals use to prevent contact with the stimuli that trigger fear responses. A common example of an avoidance behavior for an individual with a spider phobia is refusing to go into a basement where spiders have been encountered in the past. The term <emphasis>escape</emphasis> includes overt, gross motor behaviors that individuals use to reduce or eliminate contact with the triggering stimulus. A common example of an escape behavior for an individual with claustrophobia is leaving a crowded store to feel less anxious.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Avoidance<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Avoidance</primary>
         </indexterm> and escape behaviors can also involve <emphasis>covert avoidance</emphasis> behaviors, including cognitive and attentional processes, such as distracting oneself from thinking about a feared stimulus. Avoidance behaviors can also be distinguished as those that happen prior to encountering the feared stimulus, and those that happen in the presence of the feared stimulus. Those that happen in the presence of the feared stimulus are known as <emphasis>safety behaviors</emphasis>. Safety behaviors, also known as in-situation avoidance behaviors, are defined as subtle avoidance behaviors that are intended to prevent a feared catastrophe (Helbig-Lang &amp; Petermann, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). As examples, someone with acrophobia (fear of heights) might avoid looking out of a window in a tall building; someone afraid of escalators might grip the rubber handrail while riding an escalator; someone with social anxiety might avoid eye contact when speaking with a potential dating partner; and some people with panic disorder monitor their heart rate when afraid. These behaviors maintain the presenting problem because they ironically increase the salience and likelihood of feared consequences. Like other avoidance and escape behaviors, they also prevent exposure to the feared stimulus and preclude opportunities for the individual to have experiences that would reduce their perceptions of threat.</para>
