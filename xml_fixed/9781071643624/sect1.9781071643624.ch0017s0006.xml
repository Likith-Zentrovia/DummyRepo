      </indexterm> the necessary information to make a categorical SUD diagnosis using DSM-5-TR or ICD-11 criteria, additional information is needed to develop a comprehensive, multi-dimensional diagnosis. For instance, a more detailed self-report assessment of one’s frequency and degree of use across specific drug classes and associated impairment can provide a more detailed clinical picture to supplement a categorical diagnosis, and this also facilitates the development of an individualized treatment plan. Understanding the function of substance use and mechanistic phenotypes can help inform what factors may be driving substance use for an individual and, therefore, the appropriate type of treatment and outcome monitoring. Further, the inclusion of co-occurring psychopathology as part of an SUD diagnosis is crucial.</para>

An accurate diagnosis will differentiate psychological symptoms that (a) are merely effects of intoxication<indexterm significance="normal">
