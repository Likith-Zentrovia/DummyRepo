   <para role="Para">The information<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> needed for making a diagnosis of schizophrenia involves the interviewee’s self-report, behavioral observation, and, if possible, collateral information. The clinical interview is the primary vehicle for gathering a description of symptoms and functioning. As such, it is critical to create a comfortable interview experience conducive to obtaining the most accurate information. In large part, this can be accomplished through use of standard clinical skills<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>skills</primary>
      </indexterm> involved in developing rapport and engaging the individual in the interview. It is also helpful to provide a careful description of the purpose of the interview and its duration. If feasible, offering the interviewee the opportunity to take a brief break can also enhance rapport and participation in the interview.</para>
   <para role="Para">We have found that<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm>the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Clinician Version (SCID-5, CV; First et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>), is a useful way to organize the diagnostic interview. It has a standardized semi-structured format that is comprehensive yet flexible enough to allow clinicians to pursue additional follow-up questions or clarifications to determine if the diagnostic criteria are fulfilled. It can be tailored for the individual’s clinical presentation and is well suited for diagnostic interviewing in schizophrenia. The SCID-5 is divided into modules that correspond to DSM-5 disorders and includes standard questions for eliciting symptoms for each specific diagnostic criterion as well as appropriate rule-outs for each disorder. Each<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Each</primary>
      </indexterm>symptom is rated as “absent (or subthreshold)” or “present.” Two SCID-5 modules, the Psychotic and Associated Symptoms Module and the<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>the</primary>
      </indexterm>Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Disorders Module, provide most of the information needed to make (or rule out) a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The Psychotic and Associated Symptoms Module addresses specific symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Disorders Module provides a series of questions to determine how to best classify the identified psychotic symptoms (e. g., a mood disorder with psychosis vs. schizophrenia). The interview is intended to be supplemented with all available information when making a diagnosis including the medical record (when available), referral information, and observations from family members and other clinicians.</para>

      </indexterm> rapport with the interviewee by gathering more general information with questions that tend to be non-threatening. It provides the opportunity to obtain general information about mental health history, the nature of the onset of illness, and mental health treatment, all from the interviewee’s perspective. This information can inform the interviewer’s initial hypotheses about diagnosis and which symptom domains to follow up on in greater detail later in the interview. The overview is also an excellent chance to observe how the person behaves in the interview<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm>situation and how they respond to questions. These observations can be critical in diagnostic interviews for schizophrenia. For example, what is the quantity of information contained in responses? Is there a paucity or overabundance of information (i. e., circumstantiality)? How coherent are responses? Does the interviewee minimize or deny symptoms? Do they provide vague or detailed descriptions? On the basis of these observations, the interviewer may need to tailor the<indexterm significance="normal">
