   <para role="Para">The group<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>group</primary>
      </indexterm> of Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD) is a heterogeneous group of different<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>different</primary>
      </indexterm>mental disorders. This diagnostic group has undergone significant modifications over the past decade. The Somatoform Disorders in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2000</phrase>
      </emphasis>) were replaced by the renamed and reconceptualized group of SSRD in the fifth revision of the DSM (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>). <emphasis>Somatic Symptom Disorder</emphasis> (SSD) replaced the previous diagnostic entities of Somatization Disorder, Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorders, and Pain Disorder in the DSM-IV. <emphasis>Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder</emphasis> (<emphasis>FNSD</emphasis>) represents the equivalent to the former Conversion Disorder, as does <emphasis>Illness Anxiety Disorder</emphasis> (<emphasis>IAD</emphasis>) to the former Hypochondriasis. <emphasis>Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions</emphasis> (<emphasis>PFAOMC</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Factitious Disorder</emphasis> (<emphasis>FD</emphasis>) were not included in the former group of Somatoform Disorders in the DSM-IV but in other chapters. By introducing the SSRD, the requirement<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>requirement</primary>
      </indexterm> of distinguishing between medically unexplained and explained physical symptoms was abolished and the focus was shifted to symptom-related psychological distress. In this sense, the DSM-5 makes an impactful step in counteracting body-mind dualism by including psychological features as classification criteria and conceptualizing somatic symptoms in terms of a biopsychosocial model. In the following, the features of each SSRD are described in detail. Note these disorders were not revised in the text revision of the DSM-5, the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

Individuals who predominantly experience somatic symptoms and who present with anxieties about their symptoms and behaviors that aim at symptom relief are classified with SSD.

         </indexterm>” which is a more severe form of chronic fabrication of symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <primary>behavior</primary>
         </indexterm>might represent criminal behavior. A more modern form of FD is indicated as “by internet” or “by Google,” when stories of illness are disseminated on the internet. Methods that individuals who are diagnosed with FD apply to feign or produce symptoms vary. Examples are false or exaggerated reports of symptoms, exacerbating existing disease (e. g., interfering with wound healing), psychiatric symptoms through use of psychoactive substances<indexterm significance="normal">
