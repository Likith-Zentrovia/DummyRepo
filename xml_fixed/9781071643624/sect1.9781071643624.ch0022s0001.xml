            <primary>life</primary>
         </indexterm>expectancy has dramatically increased over the past century, and more adults experience healthier and longer lives, this basic question has taken on a special urgency. Aging, by definition<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>definition</primary>
         </indexterm>, is a lifelong biological process, linked to socio-cultural referents and potentially accelerated or slowed by factors as varied as genetics and lifestyle (American Psychological Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Current social convention typically defines older adulthood as beginning around 60–65 years. Based upon this convention, older adults currently comprise 16% of the US population, or 54 million people, and with the aging of the baby boomer cohort, will comprise 22% of the population by 2040 (Administration on Aging, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Importantly, the older adult population reflects a heterogenous spectrum across functioning and health status, racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and cultural identities, geographical location, and financial/housing security. Of the current older adult population in the United States, 61% identify as White (US Census, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>) with projections for increasing racial and ethnic diversity, with the aging Latinx population to experience the most substantial growth (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, though exact estimates are difficult due to lack of consistently collected epidemiological data, by the year 2030, there will be approximately seven million older adult Americans who identify as LGBTQ+ (GLAAD, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therefore, approaches to diagnostic interviewing with<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>with</primary>
         </indexterm> older adults must integrate and center a lens of cultural responsiveness, cultural humility, and inclusive and affirming practices (Dixon et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Critical to clinical work with older adults is also an awareness of and efforts to mitigate the impacts of ageism. Unfortunately, age-related bias continues to be pervasive and can substantially impact the process and results of a diagnostic interview both in implicit and explicit ways. One way to avoid ageism is to not assume homogeneity across older adults or to equate age with functionality. Thus, this chapter includes discussion of risk and contextual factors that can assist clinicians to differentiate diagnoses from each other and from normal aging processes. Recommendations will be provided throughout for approaches to diagnostic interviewing that balance the unique needs and circumstances of older adults as a whole with also tending to heterogeneity in aging. Overall, the purpose of this chapter is to provide mental health clinicians with contextual information on psychological conditions in older adults, guidelines for the interview process that may be distinctive for older adult patients, and issues to weigh when determining a diagnosis and recommendations.</para>

      <title>Unique Considerations for Diagnosis and Assessment of Older Adults</title>
      <para role="Para">The Pike’s Peak Model for Training in Geropsychology (Knight et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>) defines four overarching<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>overarching</primary>
         </indexterm>competencies that are relevant to interviewing older adults. A basic knowledge of normal aging as a reference point for holistic assessment is a primary competency. Normal aging is characterized by biological, cognitive, and psychological changes and can be impacted by disease, genetics, diet/exercise, environment (e. g., resource access), social support, mental health, personality, culture, and attitudes around aging. Broadly speaking, the realities of normal aging contradict common myths about older adulthood. Examples of such myths include the perception that older adulthood is characterized by loneliness, physical frailty, cognitive decline, and depressed mood. While some older adults may experience cognitive, emotional, and physical challenges, most do not (Mitina et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). When conducting a diagnostic interview with an older adult, it is important to recognize the heterogeneity of the aging process and substantial variance that occurs across individuals and biopsychosocial domains.</para>
      <para role="Para">A second foundational<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>foundational</primary>
         </indexterm>knowledge competency is an understanding of unique aspects of psychological conditions in late life. An awareness of differences in prevalence rates, age of onset, phenomenology, measurement, and differential risk and protective factors is fundamental to accurately diagnosing psychological conditions in older adults (Knight et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A number of these factors will be discussed throughout the chapter. Thirdly, since medical illness is common in this population, mental health clinicians should understand the interplay between physical and psychological health, and their relationship to functional impairment in later life. These problems often present concurrently and have reciprocal relationships, requiring the evaluation and distinction of physical and psychological health factors’ contributions<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>contributions</primary>
         </indexterm>to functional change. Finally, clinicians working with older adults should recognize age-specific environmental contexts in which older adults reside. Older adults may reside or be assessed in a variety of environments and settings or contexts (e. g., community vs. long-term care; medical vs. psychiatric; living with family/others vs. alone). Accurate assessment and related recommendations may occur at the level of the person, environment, or both and require knowledge of age-specific systems, and familial and cultural contexts (for additional information on working<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">One purpose of interviewing and assessing older adults is to determine an accurate diagnosis, which includes detecting problems that would otherwise be masked, distinguishing mental disorders from typical emotional states, and differentiating one mental disorder from another. Doing so requires basic knowledge of the prevalence of mental disorders, sub-clinical psychological symptoms, and high-priority clinical issues, such as suicidal behavior, in older adults. Some general principles guide the evidence-based assessment<indexterm significance="normal">

         <para role="Para">A more nuanced picture emerges with the rates of subthreshold symptoms and differences in symptom presentations in this population. For example, although older adults are less likely to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder relative to younger adults, subthreshold depressive symptoms are more common in older adult men (10–12%) and women (15–18%) and may increase slightly with age (National Institute on Aging,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2007</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Older adults appear less likely than younger adults to endorse affective and ideational symptoms (Krishnamoorthy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2020</phrase>
            </emphasis>), but more likely to report difficulties with sleep, appetite, fatigue, and executive functioning, suggesting that screening tools ideally should account for all of these. A similar picture emerges from research on anxiety disorders, in that older<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>older</primary>
            </indexterm>adults are less likely than younger adults to meet the criteria for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, but worry-based disorders (such as generalized anxiety disorder [GAD] and agoraphobia) may be more common. Rates of subthreshold anxiety symptoms (17–21%) remain relatively higher, however (Jacobs &amp; Bamonti, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2022</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Thus, screening for subthreshold symptoms may be warranted and some screening instruments (e. g., GAD-7 [general anxiety disorder 7-item]) developed for younger populations may require recalibrated norms or cutoff scores for older adults (Vasiliadis et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2015</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Further, difference in prevalence depending on context should be considered, as well as the need for screening; for example, posttraumatic stress disorder is more common in military veteran populations, particularly in those who use VA services (Moye et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2022</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Evaluation of sleep-wake disorders is also of relevance to clinicians working with older adults. Sleep disorders relate to cognition and may even represent early signs of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease and<indexterm significance="normal">

            </indexterm> dementia with Lewy bodies (Arvanitakis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

As older adults, and particularly older White men (age 75+) have the highest rate of death by suicide in the United States, routine evaluation is warranted (Mize et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2024</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Assessment of immediate risk factors, such as current suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, might begin with high-sensitivity queries (e. g., “Have you wished that you might fall asleep and not wake up?” or “Do you sometimes have thoughts that life is not worth living?”) and proceed to questions more specific to suicide (“Have you been thinking about how you might do this?”) drawn from measures such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Mai et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

            </emphasis>). Unique stressors affecting older adults that can put them at risk for suicidality include declining health, chronic pain, social isolation, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, multiple bereavements, and involuntary retirement (Mize et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         <para role="Para">Functional status is essential to assess in the context of possible cognitive impairment and implicitly serves as an evaluation of the individual’s safety. Most common safety concerns include risk to others (e. g., driving) or to oneself (e. g., self-neglect or unintentional self-injury). Individuals with major neurocognitive disorders often have impaired functioning in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; e. g., managing bank accounts or medications) and, with progression, activities of daily living (ADLs; e. g., eating, bathing) which can result in safety risks. Those with undetected or unmonitored cognitive impairment may have difficulty with managing cooking, inadequately provide themselves with<indexterm significance="normal">

            </indexterm> nutrition, or difficulty managing medications. Impaired functioning in areas such as driving, managing finances, or caregiving for others may place others’ safety at risk. Depending on the level of impairment, such difficulties may not be noticed by the individual but are commonly reported by caregivers or other collateral sources. In assessing safety and considering collateral information, care should be taken to also attend to the older adult client’s sense of autonomy and differentiate behaviors that are within their capacity to engage in safely and independently (Usher &amp; Stapleton, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         <para role="Para">Safety not only includes consideration of community context, but also the older adults’ living and relationship circumstances. Although domestic violence can occur across adults of all ages, older adults with disability, frailty, income insecurity, or cognitive impairment (Lachs &amp; Pillemer,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2015</phrase>

            </emphasis>), are at high risk of elder abuse, which may include physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse, as well as neglect and financial exploitation. An evaluation<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>evaluation</primary>
            </indexterm> of potential elder abuse requires careful attention to issues of consent and confidentiality, separate interviews of an older adult and their caregiver, open-ended interview questions, and validation of concerns for safety, and often consultation with allied health<indexterm significance="normal">

            </indexterm>medical illness is so common in later life, older adults’ psychological problems are more likely to occur in the context of medical illness, disability, or the treatments (e. g., medications) for these problems (Agustini et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2020</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Medical and psychological disorders often have reciprocal relationships, adding complexity to a diagnostic interview and to interpreting symptom rating scales. For example, it is common for those undergoing cancer treatment to also experience fatigue which can result from cancer treatment, cancer itself, and/or depression (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2019</phrase>
            </emphasis>). It is important to take a careful history of both medical and psychological problems, including the onset of each, and to adopt an agnostic<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>agnostic</primary>
            </indexterm> approach to rating current symptoms. Through such an approach, it might be determined, for example, that the excess fatigue became evident prior to diagnosis of lung cancer and was further exacerbated by the impacts of chemotherapy but that it was not accompanied by other depression symptoms (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2019</phrase>
            </emphasis>). Clinicians may engage in a “sorting out” process, often informed by chronological markers in the older adult’s narrative of the problem. Additional information on differentiating<indexterm significance="normal">
