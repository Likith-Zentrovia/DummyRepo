   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">In addition to maintaining a multicultural framework, there are several key areas that must be considered in order to develop an informed understanding, diagnosis, and recommendations when assessing an older adult. Though these factors are not necessarily unique to older adults, they increase in importance in later life and include: careful assessment of the patient’s medical context and medications, their cognitive functioning, influences on psychiatric diagnoses, and consideration of life circumstances.</para>

      <title>Medical Conditions and Medication Side Effects</title>
      <para role="Para">Multimorbidity and polypharmacy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>polypharmacy</primary>
         </indexterm> are highly prevalent among older adults. Physical illnesses and injuries that cause chronic pain may interfere with one’s ability to focus, as well as learn and retain information. Fatigue, loss of interest, and cognitive dysfunction are common among individuals with autoimmune conditions such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Pryce &amp; Fontana, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Cancer and side effects from its treatments also commonly cause somatic symptoms of depression, including appetite or weight loss, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and diminished concentration (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Identifying an underlying physical illness causing depression-like symptoms can be a challenge for clinicians. Although there is no single test that can differentiate depression caused by psychiatric illness from a medical condition masquerading as depression<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>depression</primary>
         </indexterm>, clinicians should assess for features uncharacteristic of a true depressive disorder and confer with the patient’s physician to obtain laboratory testing when possible. Furthermore, mental health professionals may often encounter patients experiencing depression as a psychological reaction to their non-psychiatric medical illness. Depression rates are elevated among individuals with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Agustini et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Depressive symptoms in patients with these conditions could be viewed as natural reactions to the pain, medical costs, burdensome self-management regimens, and functional impairment associated with these illnesses. Because many physical illnesses are more common in late life, it is particularly important for clinicians to take these stressors into account when evaluating older patients.</para>
      <para role="Para">With this increase in medical comorbidities, there is a risk for polypharmacy (i. e., combinations of medications that may interact or may be unneeded) and adverse events, including delirium (Liang et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Polypharmacy has been associated with cognitive decline in older adult (Wastesson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>) with psychotropic (e. g., benzodiazepines) and anticholinergic medications (e. g., Benadryl) having particularly strong associations with reversible cognitive impairment (Wastesson et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, chemotherapy agents, anti-hypertensives (beta-blockers), steroids (e. g. Prednisone), and opiates/narcotic analgesics can also adversely<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>adversely</primary>
         </indexterm> affect cognitive function.</para>

         Cognitive functioning<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Cognitive functioning</primary>
         </indexterm>is an important concern that can impact quality of life and affect one’s ability to live independently. While some modest cognitive changes can occur in later life due to normal aging (e. g., decreased speed of processing, difficulty with divided attention, decreased mental flexibility/abstraction), most older adults do not develop cognitive decline that significantly impacts functioning (Lighthall et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Older adults with normal age-related changes are able to perform daily activities and maintain independence. They are also likely to be aware of their cognitive changes and can compensate for them. Conversely, individuals with dementia are more likely to have limited awareness and insight into their decline in intellectual functioning (Arvanitakis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, behavioral and emotional symptoms, such as agitation, suspiciousness, apathy, and personality changes, may accompany the cognitive decline seen in older adults with dementia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>dementia</primary>
         </indexterm>but are typically not observed in people with normal age-related cognitive changes.</para>
      <para role="Para">More notable cognitive decline occurs in adults with dementia, otherwise known as major neurocognitive disorder. Dementia affects 57.4 million adults worldwide and is projected to become substantially more prevalent over the next several decades due to population growth and extended lifespans (GBD 2019 Dementia Forecasting Collaborators,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Major neurocognitive disorder is characterized by non-acute decline in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, recognition, executive functioning, language, and/or motor skills, representing a change from previous functioning and severe enough to interfere with daily life. The most common etiological subtypes are Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia (Arvanitakis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A key feature of dementia is significant interference with occupational or social functioning.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Mild cognitive impairment/minor neurocognitive disorder (MCI)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Mild cognitive impairment/minor neurocognitive disorder (MCI)</primary>
         </indexterm>, sometimes a precursor to dementia, is characterized by modest cognitive decline in one or more domains, but these deficits do not interfere with one’s ability to be independent (Manly et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). MCI represents a stage between normal age-related cognitive changes and more severe cognitive decline seen in dementia. Unlike adults experiencing normal age-related cognitive changes, those experiencing MCI may experience difficulties in executive functioning or difficulty learning new information, and such problems may be due to a reversible medical condition or medication side effect. Diagnosing these issues should involve a clinical interview, and bloodwork, possibly supplemented by neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Older adults with MCI may be advised to get neuropsychological testing on an annual basis to track changes in cognitive functioning, as MCI<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MCI</primary>
         </indexterm>can be indicative of early signs of dementia and develop further.</para>
      <para role="Para">Delirium can also be present in older adults with more acute medical conditions and is important to differentiate from a more pervasive neurocognitive issue. In contrast to MCI<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MCI</primary>
         </indexterm> or dementia, delirium is a temporary state characterized by marked changes in alertness and attention, consequent global cognitive changes, fluctuating presenting symptoms, and associated features including an alteration in the sleep-wake cycle. Unlike dementia, which has a gradual onset and is generally chronic, delirium is acute, potentially developing over the course of a few hours or days, and is often treatable when the underlying medical cause is detected (Liang et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Importantly, hypoactive, as opposed to hyperactive delirium, is often underrecognized in older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment or physical limitations, and may also be mistaken for depressed mood (Anand &amp; Mac Lullich,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Risk factors include dementia, frailty, taking multiple psychoactive medications, serious illness, and significant routine changes. Acute medical causes of delirium include viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, brain injury, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, dehydration, vitamin deficiencies (e. g., B12 or thiamine), sleep deprivation, withdrawal from drugs or alcohol, organ failure, and psychoactive medications (e. g., opiates or benzodiazepines) can cause delirium. Mental health clinicians may assist a team in detecting delirium in conjunction with a medical workup. Treatment is centered on addressing the underlying cause of delirium and may include deprescribing medications.</para>

      <title>Psychiatric Diagnostic Categories and Considerations for Older Adults</title>
      <para role="Para">The identification of psychiatric diagnoses<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>psychiatric diagnoses</primary>
         </indexterm>in older adults should bear in mind several considerations, including risk and protective factors, symptom presentation, and reporting bias. With regard to risk and protective factors, both are highly contextual and depend on an older adult’s individual, familial, and cultural circumstances. However, examples can include older adults being at greater risk for changes in key roles in life (e. g., becoming a caregiver to a partner), developing medical illness that impacts functioning, or financial insecurity. On the other hand, older adults may also experience protective factors such as greater self-concept, multigenerational social supports, or engagement in meaningful activities and roles.</para>
      <para role="Para">Presentation of various<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>various</primary>
         </indexterm> DSM-5-TR syndromes may differ in older adults based on risk and protective factors, including life circumstances, comorbidities, and age of onset. Clinically significant depressive symptoms that do not meet DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode are common in older adults. Depression in older adults may be more likely to manifest as withdrawal, apathy, and anhedonia, as opposed to affective symptoms like “sadness” (Krishnamoorthy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Further, definitions of what it means to be depressed might differ by cohort. Bereavement is prevalent among older adults, and may be confused by a provider with symptoms of major depression (Boelen &amp; Lenferink, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The clinical manifestation<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>manifestation</primary>
         </indexterm> of anxiety in older adults may also differ from that of younger adults. In particular, anxiety symptoms in older adults are frequently misattributed to medical causes and limited insight (Jacobs &amp; Bamonti, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Similarly, ageist stereotypes may contribute to viewing the avoidance of social activities as normative rather than a symptom of depression or anxiety. It is important that clinicians conducting diagnostic interviewing with older adults work to build rapport, maintain cultural humility, and consider the<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> various influences on the older adult and their presentation.</para>

      <title>Life Stressors Common in Older Adulthood</title>
      <para role="Para">Concurrent life stressors<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>life stressors</primary>
         </indexterm> are always important to consider in thorough assessment and, in the case of older adults, certain changes and related stressors may be more common than in younger groups. These include retirement, divorce, bereavement, or moving to assisted living or institutional residential settings. Changed circumstances can produce a sense of instability that can impact older adults with cognitive impairment or pre-existing mental health concerns. In the wake of significant life transitions, an older adult may face challenges to their sense of identity and purpose, changes in meaningful activities and roles, grief, and social impacts (Kellehear &amp; Garrido, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Such challenges can paradoxically come with new possibilities and an increased urgency to engage in creating a life of meaning that may conflict with limitations such as financial insecurity or chronic illness and result in increased distress.</para>
      <para role="Para">Bereavement may be used as an example in that it presents particularly unique challenges in terms of diagnostic interviewing. The death of significant others (e. g., spouse/partner, sibling, friends, adult children) is an inevitable part of aging, and losses may accumulate over time. Though most bereaved individuals will adapt to loss, a subset may be at risk for developing bereavement-related mental health challenges, including prolonged grief disorder, major depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (Roberts et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This is particularly the case if the bereaved older adult is socially isolated, disconnected from sources of meaning, or experiences multiple concurrent losses. Furthermore, bereavement reactions can be complicated by and trigger cognitive and physical decline. When assessing older adults, caution should be taken to not pathologize grief reactions in the acutely bereaved, yet to also explore to what extent functioning is<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>is</primary>
         </indexterm> impacted by bereavement as a significant stressor. Additional information on bereavement-related disorders can be found in (Boelen &amp; Lenferink, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">Taken together, medical and cognitive comorbidities, unique risk and protective factors in older adults for psychiatric diagnoses, and life events that may be more likely to occur (and occur in succession) in older adults may all have an impact on their symptom presentation, the interview process, and diagnostic conclusions. Culturally responsive, multimethod assessment offers a useful avenue for addressing and integrating these<indexterm significance="normal">
