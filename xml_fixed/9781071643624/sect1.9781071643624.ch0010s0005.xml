   <title>Case Illustration</title>
   <para role="Para">Louise was a 29-year-old Caucasian woman seeking an assessment for symptoms of distress around social interactions, feelings of isolation, low mood, and difficulties focusing while attending academic classes. At the time of the assessment, Louise was living with her long-term partner, attending university full-time, and working part-time. She stated that she had a hard time interacting with people besides her partner and would become extremely upset if she believed someone was upset with her or that she was being rejected by someone. She sometimes cried in public when someone was upset with her and after conflict with or feeling distant from her partner and had a difficult time making new friends. Louise also reported frequently feeling overwhelmed by tasks she needed to complete, leading her to procrastinate and to be late or not complete them. Louise originally expressed the belief that she would meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</primary>
      </indexterm> due to her distress around social interactions and information she had read about ASD online.</para>
   <para role="Para">Due to the range of symptoms reported during the initial unstructured general intake interview, the assessment proceeded to the DIAMOND. This interview protocol helps the clinician to differentiate between similar presenting disorders. Louise filled out the DIAMOND screener which allowed the clinician to focus on the potentially relevant diagnosis. She endorsed the prompts related to social anxiety disorder, GAD, and MDD. One of Louise’s main areas of concern was her issues with social interactions. She expressed worrying frequently about what others thought of her, feeling like she could not connect with others, and having difficulty maintaining eye contact (which was also observed by the clinician). According to her responses to the DIAMOND, Louise was able to maintain some social relationships and a positive romantic relationship. However, she stated that she finds it hard to maintain some of these relationships because she constantly worries that she has upset or is disliked by the other person. This fear often leads her to avoid social interactions that she would otherwise like to engage in. Her responses on the DIAMOND indicated that she met the criteria for social anxiety disorder.</para>
   <para role="Para">Although Louise expressed feeling anxiety outside of a direct social context, she did not meet the criteria for GAD because her anxiety and worry all involved being socially evaluated by others. For example, she experienced high levels of anxiety which prevented her from working on her art but stated that this anxiety was due to thoughts that others would not like her work. Louise expressed having trouble completing other minor tasks like chores because she felt overwhelmed by them. In responding to the interview questions on the DIAMOND, it became clear these feelings were better related to low motivation rather than feelings of anxiety. This symptom, along with general feelings of low mood, negative thoughts, and loss of interest in other activities were consistent with criteria for MDD.</para>
   <para role="Para">The last potential diagnosis that needed to be assessed for was ASD. Since none of the structured interviews assess for both anxiety disorders and ASD, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2012</phrase>
      </emphasis>) was administered to see if Louise would meet the criteria for an ASD diagnosis. Although Louise did express discomfort around social interaction and eye contact, she did not exhibit unusually restricted interests, inflexibility to change, stereotyped movements, or deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. This absence of ASD symptoms indicated that Louise’s reported difficulty with social interactions and maintaining relationships is likely better explained by the MDD and social anxiety disorder diagnoses. Scores on the self-report measures of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1996</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale—Short Form (SIAS-SF) further documented elevated levels of depression and social anxiety symptoms.</para>
   <para role="Para">Louise’s initial belief that she would meet the criteria for ASD presented a potential challenge for the feedback session. The results and observations from the ADOS-2 were particularly helpful in reframing Louise’s experience. Rather than showing deficits in social and emotional reciprocity due to a lack of perception of social cues, Louise readily agreed that she was painfully aware of and overly sensitive to social cues. Social anxiety disorder was framed as due to overvaluing others’ opinions, which she readily accepted as describing herself.</para>
