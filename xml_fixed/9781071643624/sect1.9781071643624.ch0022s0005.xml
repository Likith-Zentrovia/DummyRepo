   <para role="Para">It is critical<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>critical</primary>
      </indexterm> to contextualize diagnostic interviewing procedures and interpretation in consideration of a patient’s cultural background and intersecting identities, including but not limited to age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability. Sociocultural factors shape the diagnostic interviewing process among older adults, and the interplay of clinician, patient, and institutional sociocultural contexts inherently influences the clinical encounter in explicit and implicit ways. Clinicians engaging in diagnostic interviewing with minoritized individuals should take steps to mitigate the exacerbation of clinician-patient power dynamics that can manifest. Part of this process involves cultivating an awareness of the sociocultural contexts of a given patient population. For example, generational and age-related factors should be considered. Some studies have shown that older adults can have greater difficulty in recognizing mental health symptoms due to conflating symptoms with the normal aging process (Malkin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). This can, in turn, contribute to pessimistic attitudes<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>attitudes</primary>
      </indexterm>about mental health treatment and its efficacy, and ultimately underutilization of mental health services (Malkin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Adding to this picture, literature has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ older adults may mistrust mental health providers; this mistrust is shaped by fear of and actual mistreatment, stereotypes, racism, transphobia, heterosexism, and other biases within the mental healthcare system encountered across a lifetime (Casanova-Perez et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Cultural and language differences between patients and clinicians can also contribute to difficulty understanding providers, a sense of not feeling understood, and feeling disrespected (Suite et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2007</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Ageism is a sociocultural and interpersonal influence that must be considered when interviewing older adults. It is well-established that ageism (defined as age-related stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination) has adverse effects on the physical and mental health of older adults, worsening chronic health conditions and memory, and increasing rates of depression and hospitalizations (Allen et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Ageist<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Ageist</primary>
      </indexterm>attitudes can be implicit or explicit and come in many forms in healthcare, including use of “elderspeak,” (e. g., talking to an older adult as if they are a child, oversimplifying information), assumptions about lack of independence, ignoring sexual health needs, or dismissing/underestimating health concerns. Clinicians working with older adults should take active steps to reduce ageism in their encounters, address and change approach when ageism occurs (e. g., in the form of an age-related microaggression), and advocate for their older adult patients when ageism is apparent across a healthcare team or setting.</para>
   <para role="Para">Race and ethnicity can have unique<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>unique</primary>
      </indexterm>impacts on the aging process, with specific challenges experienced by minoritized racial and ethnic older adults (Trinh et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Racial and ethnic older adult populations often face health and healthcare disparities, including higher rates of unaddressed physical and mental health conditions and limited access to inclusive and quality services (Forrester et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Jimenez et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Such disparities have been shown to be influenced by minority stress factors, including discrimination across a lifetime, bias in institutions and clinicians, and income inequities (Lavingia et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">The provision of an inclusive and culturally competent interview and related feedback should also consider cultural context around well-being and beliefs about mental health. For example, recent cross-cultural surveys illustrate that the relation of positive affect to age across the life-cycle varies markedly by world region and culture (Helliwell et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2024</phrase>
      </emphasis>). In terms of beliefs about mental health, studies have found a common belief among Black, Asian, and Latinx older adult groups in the United States that mental illness originates from familial disruption (Jimenez et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). For Asian Americans and Latinx older<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>older</primary>
      </indexterm>adults, this notion may be linked to migration and relocation, which can shape cultural dynamics and exert a profound impact on health perspectives and beliefs. Intergenerational and extended family support can significantly impact well-being, and the family environment can provide valuable context for understanding symptoms and functioning. It is thus imperative for clinicians to be mindful of racialized disparities in care, cross-cultural differences in influences on mental health, and ensure conclusions are holistically informed and culturally contextualized.</para>
   <para role="Para">Older adults who hold a minoritized gender and/or sexual orientation are also likely to face significant mental health and healthcare disparities. LGBTQ+<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>individuals</primary>
      </indexterm> are a rapidly growing segment of the older adult population, yet remain vulnerable to experienced and anticipated forms of discrimination, victimization with violence, microaggressions, and internalized cisheternormativity (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Preston, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2024</phrase>
      </emphasis>). LGBTQ+ racial and ethnic minority older adults in particular experience exclusion, isolation, and diminished social support within the LGBTQ+ community, due<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>due</primary>
      </indexterm> to the dominance of a White and youth-focused culture (Chen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Similarly, trans LGBTQ older adults face a myriad of unique concerns with aging. Data from the Trans Metlife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals, one of the largest databases of its kind, has illustrated that trans people of color and those living with disability have many concerns regarding aging, including anticipated discrimination, loss of control, and poor quality of life, particularly related to receipt or not of gender affirming care (Walker et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Overall, studies have shown that many LGBTQ+ people experience fears of anticipated mistreatment or marginalization as they age, particularly with regard to institutions or providers being biased and non-inclusive (Casanova-Perez et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Clinicians conducting diagnostic interviewing should also be aware of the unique stressors that may be faced by minoritized individuals and consider this in conclusions and recommendations.</para>

         </indexterm> effective healthcare. Cultural competence<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Cultural competence</primary>
         </indexterm> can involve gaining knowledge about the needs, experiences, and preferences of particular communities a clinician is likely to encounter. While greater knowledge of a particular group can help to increase understanding of certain experiences, including discrimination and victimization, it is important to avoid stereotyping and consider intersecting identities that contribute to unique individualized experiences of older adults (Trinh et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In some ways, this very chapter could be considered as having a framing of cultural competence in describing the unique considerations for conducting interviews with older adults broadly. This approach has been critiqued for obscuring intersectionality and implying that a clinician can reach a level of “knowing” about a given community or cultural group. Thus, cultural humility<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>cultural humility</primary>
         </indexterm>, an ongoing process of clinicians reflecting on<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>on</primary>
         </indexterm> their own identities, values, and biases and how these impact, intersect, and interact with patient identities and experiences (Tervalon &amp; Murray-García, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>), is also necessary. The combination of these approaches to multicultural practice can offer an approach to mitigating disparities experienced by older adults in mental healthcare, at least on a clinician level (Greene-Moton &amp; Minkler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In establishing rapport with patients via empathy and openness, it is also essential to ensure that language barriers are addressed to facilitate communication. Language difficulties between patients and providers can lead to inaccurate and inadequate evaluations and misdiagnosis and further contribute to healthcare disparities (Llorente &amp; Valverde, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>); thus, interpretation through bilingual staff, medical interpreters, qualified translators, friends and family members, and telephone/telehealth interpreter services may assist the interview process.
