   <title>Basic Skills in Interviewing</title>
   <para role="Para">In this section, we provide an overview of some of the foundational concepts and skills that impact clinical and diagnostic interviews.</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0002s0004s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Using Reflection</title>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis>Reflection statements</emphasis> address what the client has communicated (verbally or nonverbally) and are typically used to highlight a specific point. A reflection statement, however brief, usually marks a specific feeling or point of information and thus can be divided into <emphasis>reflection of feelings</emphasis> or <emphasis>reflection of content</emphasis>. Liberal use of both throughout clinical interviews is advised. Indeed, reflection is an important tool for any interviewer. When a clinician reflects a client’s feelings or the content of what a client is saying, or both simultaneously, this accomplishes two important tasks. First, it conveys a sense of empathy to the client by sending a message that the client is accurately understood, which strengthens the therapeutic bond. Second, it provides a mirror image for the client of what they are feeling and saying. This “clinician mirror” is an invaluable method for the client to learn about himself or herself (Johnston et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Reflection is a skill that assists clients to monitor and identify different feeling states and also to express those states in a healthy way.</para>
      <para role="Para">Mastery of this skill does not mean that the clinician mimes or mimics the responses of the client. Reflection of feeling can be delivered in a simple phrase, such as “Sounds like you are feeling…,” “You must be feeling…,” or “I hear that you are feeling….” Reflection of content means that the clinician accurately paraphrases or summarizes the client’s statements, reflecting the “essence” of what the client communicated but not using the exact words or phrases. Think of this skill as helping the client in “getting to the heart of the matter” (Johnston et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>) but not parroting back to the client exactly<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>exactly</primary>
         </indexterm> what he or she said. In summary, reflective statements can aid in the development of rapport as clients perceive that they are being truly and deeply understood. In turn, the client may relay more information that further strengthens the bond and ultimately assists the clinician in determining appropriate interventions.</para>

      <title>Paying Attention to Language and Avoiding Jargon</title>
      <para role="Para">An integral part of a successful interview is the communication between clinician and client. To arrive at an accurate diagnostic picture, the clinician must communicate to the client what is being asked of him or her. The clarity and comprehensibility of the questions will facilitate identification of pertinent information while enhancing rapport and trust in the therapeutic relationship (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A common mistake that new clinicians sometimes make is their use of jargon or non-familiar vocabulary. The clinician’s use of vocabulary heavy in psychological terminology often hinders effective communication. For example, a graduate student asked her new client, “What kind of boundaries do you have with your mother?” The term <emphasis>boundaries</emphasis> may mean something completely different to the client than it does to the clinician. In this example, the student clinician risks her client answering without a clear understanding of what is being asked and possibly hindering development of an accurate case formulation. Similar risks are possible with respect to unfamiliar language. Clinicians should consider the client’s level of education, intelligence, age, background, and geographical location (Faust, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This does not mean that the clinician should “talk down to” the client in any way. It does mean that words should be chosen with consideration.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0004s03" role="Heading">
      <title>Using Humor</title>
      <para role="Para">The image of the stoic, impersonal, unflappable, and humorless clinician who is devoid of feelings is an outdated one. Certainly, being able to see the humorous elements even in the most challenging situations in one’s life can be an adaptive coping strategy for clinicians and clients alike. In the interview setting, humor has the potential to “take the edge” off a discussion of particularly painful material and can serve to release physical tension. Smiling or even laughing together can be a source of bonding between clinician and client. These positive aspects of humor notwithstanding, we generally advise cautiousness in displays of humor. For the clinician, the use of jokes or humor should be done sparingly and with caution before a therapeutic relationship is solidly formed. Although the intention of the clinician may be to lighten the mood, a humorous remark is typically not appropriate during the course of an initial clinical evaluation. When clients show the pattern of habitually using humor, sarcasm, or jokes as a way to distance themselves from feelings that are too painful or scary, the clinicians’ reaction should be dependent on the context of the situation. At times, the clinician may choose to offer a gentle interpretative statement, such as “I have noticed that when you start to experience or discuss very painful feelings, you sometimes seem to make a joke to get away from those feelings. Have you noticed this in yourself?” Like all interventions and tactics, humor has its place in the clinical interview, especially if it is timed correctly and not overused. Regardless of when humor is used, it is most imperative that clinicians<emphasis>laugh with clients</emphasis> and not at them or their predicaments.</para>

      <title>Responding to Questions from Clients and Managing Self-Disclosure</title>
      <para role="Para">How one responds to questions from clients depends on the clinician’s level of training and the types of questions being asked. In the early stages of training, beginning clinicians should generally be cautious about offering diagnostic or disposition information without first discussing the topic in supervision. For example, if during an interview a client asks, “Do you think I have schizophrenia?” the clinician should address the client’s feelings that are associated with the label but delay answering the question directly until after a consultation with the supervisor has occurred. In contrast to emotionally laden or complicated questions, simple questions of a pragmatic nature, for example, about agency policies, should be answered directly (e. g., questions about billing, payment, or times the clinic is open).</para>
      <para role="Para">Some clients ask clinicians to reveal personal information which can be a difficult situation to navigate. Should clinicians self-disclose and if so, what kind of details and how much should they reveal? Whereas clinicians have highly divergent opinions on the potential costs and benefits of self-disclosure, an occasional sharing of personal information can facilitate the interview and enhance rapport (Knox &amp; Hill,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2003</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, like the use of humor, self-disclosure must be timed appropriately and used limitedly, and perhaps most important, the “shadow side” of self-disclosure must be carefully considered.</para>
      <para role="Para">One negative impact of revealing personal details is that it frequently switches the focus of the interview from the client (where it rightfully should be) to the clinician. In some cases, clients prod clinicians for self-disclosures to test the limits of the psychotherapy relationship. Therefore, clinicians must always ask themselves about the intent and impact the disclosure could have on the client’s progress toward his or her identified goals. An inappropriate disclosure can also burden the client. As such, beginning clinicians should generally keep self-disclosure to a minimum. One guiding principle is to freely disclose details one would not mind seeing printed in the local newspaper, such as one’s age, level of training and education, and the name of one’s supervisor. Clinicians should be cautious about disclosing details of a more personal nature.</para>
      <para role="Para">When a personal disclosure is made, the clinician should be able to articulate to the supervisor the specific reason why the clinician made the disclosure, including the goal the clinician was trying to accomplish specifically by the disclosure. Clinicians should also ask themselves “Could the goal have been accomplished in another fashion that does not carry the risks associated with self-disclosure?” If not, another general guiding principle is to disclose feelings rather than facts: “I know what it feels like to be hurt by somebody I trusted” rather than “I also felt hurt when my ex-spouse cheated on me.” Should clients press for a self-disclosure (e. g., “Have you ever been assaulted”), it is advisable to reflect the client’s curiosity and try to understand what is behind the question, to illuminate the client’s assumptions or concerns about the clinician. It also helps to refocus the discussion back to the client. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for the clinician to self-disclose about any ongoing personal problems or problems with other clients.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0004s05" role="Heading">
      <title>Taking Notes</title>
      <para role="Para">Note-taking is another topic about which clinicians sometimes disagree. A general rule of thumb is to limit note-taking as much as possible during the interview. It is probably not an issue at all to take limited notes during an interview to record things like the names of family members or key details that are very significant. That being said, it is important to keep the focus on the client and not on the notepad. Indeed, excessive note-taking can be perceived as off-putting (perhaps even rude) by some clients and it can hinder development of the therapeutic alliance.</para>
