   <title>Procedures for Gathering Information</title>
   <para role="Para">The procedures for gathering information to determine a potential bipolar disorder diagnosis may vary considerably based on context, resources, time constraints, and the availability of additional informants such as family members or other providers. Ideally, this process will involve an in-person diagnostic interview conducted by a trained clinician who assesses for symptoms of bipolar or related disorders as per the DSM-5-TR (see the Recommendations for Formal Assessment section below for examples of diagnostic interview protocols). While the degree of structure within the interview may vary from an informal assessment to the use of a standardized protocol, it is always important to ask questions and respond to patients’ answers in an open, nonjudgmental, and easy-to-understand fashion. Providing opportunities for patients to describe their symptoms and concerns in their own words will allow for a better understanding of the diagnostic presentation, reinforcing that the patient’s personal experience is an invaluable component of the decision-making process.</para>
   <para role="Para">However, the interviewer should also anticipate that some patients may lack insight into the full extent of their symptoms and that more focused, close-ended questions are often necessary to gather the information needed to reach a diagnosis. This is particularly true when assessing for bipolar disorder, given that individuals with this diagnosis spend the majority of time in depressive episodes versus hypomanic or manic episodes and may be less likely to find their elevated mood states to be impairing (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>; American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Therefore, it is crucial to specifically screen for a history of hypomanic or manic symptoms regardless of the patient’s presenting concerns. An individual not assessed for these symptoms may receive an incorrect diagnosis of depression and initiate antidepressant medication; as noted above, antidepressants can trigger hypomanic or manic episodes among those with bipolar disorder, further underscoring the importance of thorough diagnostic assessment to prevent potentially harmful treatment recommendations.</para>
   <para role="Para">The interview should thoroughly assess for current and past suicidality given the elevated risk of attempted and completed suicide within this population (Baldessarini et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2006</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Jamison, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2000</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Tondo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>). This safety assessment should include assessing the patient for self-harm or harm to others, assessing the need for hospitalization, completing a validated suicide screening tool to assess for risk factors (e. g., current psychiatric conditions, recent biopsychosocial stressors, availability of lethal means, physical health conditions), assessing protective factors, and creating a crisis response/safety plan if needed (US Department of Veterans Affairs, US Department of Defense,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Possible comorbid conditions such as anxiety and substance use disorders should also be assessed, as they frequently accompany bipolar disorder and may be causing additional impairment (Bauer et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). It is important to consider additional factors that may influence the diagnostic impression, including recent stressors, prescription and recreational drug use, past history of psychotherapy or hospitalizations, and co-occurring medical conditions. Furthermore, the interviewer should be attuned to behavioral cues that may inform the diagnostic picture, including the patient’s affect, rate of speech, quality of eye contact, psychomotor functioning, and personal hygiene. Slowed speech and movement, poor hygiene, and restricted eye contact may be indicators of a possible depressive episode, whereas pressured speech and psychomotor agitation may be signs of hypomania or mania. Examination of prodromal symptoms (e. g., excessive talking or energy, irritable mood, or racing thoughts) is important in the identification of first or recurrent manic episodes (Faedda et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and can best be assessed via a structured interview (Alvarez-Cadenas et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Important information can be gained from additional informants, such as the patient’s significant other, family members, or medical providers including primary care doctors or emergency department staff. Collecting this important information from those closest to the patient can provide valuable insights into a patient’s functioning and help increase diagnostic certainty (Vöhringer &amp; Perlis,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The assessor should verify whether informed consent is needed by the patient to discuss their functioning with an additional party. As individuals with bipolar disorders may be less likely to report impairment associated with hypomania or mania, observations of outside informants can be particularly helpful in identifying periods of distinct mood changes or unusual, erratic behaviors that may ultimately qualify as hypomanic or manic episodes (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Ideally, the provider will be able to gather information from multiple sources (e. g., the patient and his or her significant other or spouse) and through various formats (e. g., interview, behavioral observation, and self-report questionnaires) to provide the most comprehensive assessment of the patient and his or her presenting concerns. However, time constraints or situational factors may preclude a thorough in-person interview. In such circumstances, it may be indicated to complete a brief structured screening measure, either administered by the provider or as a self-report questionnaire (see Recommendations for Formal Assessment section for examples), followed by a more comprehensive assessment interview if the patient screens positive.</para>
   <para role="Para">Routine screening for bipolar disorder in the general population is not recommended, especially in the primary care setting, as it may lead to high rates of false positive diagnoses. However, screening using a validated screening tool is recommended when there is suspicion of bipolar disorder (e. g., depressive or manic symptoms present) during a clinical interaction with a patient. The goal of screening tools is to aid in the decision of whether to continue pursuing a bipolar diagnosis. Additional factors to be considered as relevant to pursuing a diagnosis of bipolar disorder include: a first-degree relative with diagnosed bipolar disorder, severe initial onset of depression under the age of 25 or multiple prior episodes of depression, comorbid anxiety/substance use/depression with psychotic features, treatment-resistant depression, and dysregulated sleep patterns (US Department of Veterans Affairs, US Department of Defense,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Regardless of the measures used, efforts should be made to inform the patient of the purpose and goals of the assessment. The patient should be encouraged to ask questions and voice any concerns they may have in completing this process. Taking a collaborative stance and establishing good rapport are important to both ensure a successful assessment process as well as to create a strong foundation for future clinical work. Even if the assessor will not be providing subsequent clinical care to the patient, they serve as a representation of their field and can have a major influence on the patient’s willingness to engage in treatment.</para>
