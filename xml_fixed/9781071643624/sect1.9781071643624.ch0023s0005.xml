   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Ana is a 92-year-old bi-lingual Spanish and English-speaking Latina cisgender female who uses she/her/hers<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>she/her/hers</primary>
      </indexterm> pronouns and was referred to psychology for transfer of care from an outpatient primary care setting to a home-based primary care setting. She was engaged in outpatient psychotherapy for 1 year, addressing increased anxiety and coinciding decline in overall health. About 6 months before engaging with home-based primary care, she was experiencing difficulty attending medical appointments with an increase in fear of leaving her apartment. The outpatient psychologist transitioned care via telehealth to accommodate Ana’s fear of leaving her apartment. Treatment was at a standstill, with Ana’s symptoms appearing to worsen. Ana and the current psychologist agreed that treatment could better suit the Ana’s needs and progress if transitioned to the home-based team psychologist.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis role="strong">Chart Review</emphasis>. The medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic diarrhea. The psychiatric history is significant for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>depressive</primary>
      </indexterm> disorder, recurrent, with anxious distress and agoraphobia. Ana’s doctor prescribed several medications treating diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and depression. Her chart noted a recent inconsistency in managing her medications while also reporting an increase in symptoms related to anxiety and agoraphobia. The record review also revealed a history of intimate partner violence (IPV), a 50-year history of cigarette use, a family history of cardiovascular health problems, and colon cancer. A review of recent home-based primary care healthcare professional notes corroborated observations of inconsistent medication management, increased incontinence, accidents, and small lesions and scabs on her arms and legs, which she self-reported as a “nervous habit.” Additionally, Ana was adamant about having female-only healthcare professionals, citing extreme distrust of men.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis role="strong">Warm Hand-Off and Clinical Interview</emphasis>. A scheduled joint telehealth visit occurred between the outpatient psychologist, Ana, and the home-based psychologist. At this time, the home-based psychologist introduced themselves and reviewed their role in Ana’s home-based primary care team. The outpatient psychologist reviewed the treatment course and allowed time for Ana to share additional thoughts and questions with the new home-based psychologist. The home-based psychologist asked Ana if she preferred to have the session conducted in Spanish or English, to which she responded<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>responded</primary>
      </indexterm>, “I sometimes go back and forth, so if you can keep up, we should be fine!”. The home-based psychologist scheduled a two-week in-person follow-up and confirmed with Ana. The psychologist explained what she should expect related to reviewing her background and what Ana identifies as the current difficulty or need for psychotherapy.</para>
   <para role="Para">In preparation for the in-person visit, the home-based psychologist prepared an intake evaluation with information gathered from the chart review and collateral information from the home-based primary care team members to assist in clarification and gathering of additional pertinent information not already specified. The psychologist arrived on time, and Ana was seated in her recliner. Ana had unlocked her apartment door when the psychologist buzzed into the low-income housing complex and arrived at her door. Ana asked for the psychologist to lock the door behind them, indicating that her neighbors and other residents often “yell and slam their doors. They’ve even tried to break in here from this door and my sliding door balcony!” Ana appeared to be winded, and when the psychologist commented on the observation, she acknowledged that transferring from her motorized wheelchair to the recliner was causing her to be out of breath and that, eventually, she would return to baseline. The psychologist also observed Ana rocking back and<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>and</primary>
      </indexterm> forth in her recliner throughout the encounter. Her home appeared organized and clean, and her decorations included family photographs, art pieces, plants, and crafts.</para>
   <para role="Para">The psychologist reintroduced themselves and inquired about Ana’s pronouns and how she would like to be addressed. The psychologist proceeded with informed consent, privacy and confidentiality limits, a review of abuse and mandated reporter status, and an overview of the session. The psychologist allowed Ana to ask questions and identify her goals and concerns. The interview began with the psychologist asking about Ana’s past engagement with mental health and psychotherapy and inquiring about her experiences, what went well, what she wished would have been done, or what expectations for therapy were not met/met. Ana indicated she had previously worked on feeling less<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>less</primary>
      </indexterm> depressed by finding ways to engage creatively, which worked the best. Ana also noted she had also seen therapists for trauma work yet could not recall the type of trauma-based work or interventions she had learned, “It was a long time ago, and I find that my memory isn’t as good as it used to be.” She also shared that she attempted group-based therapy in the remote past and found it unhelpful, “I couldn’t relate to what the women were sharing.”</para>
   <para role="Para">Regarding her current concerns and symptoms, Ana reported she began experiencing increased panic when leaving her apartment following a period of distressing exchanges she overheard occurring outside her apartment, “There were three days of shouting from my direct neighbor. Someone was banging on the door, saying something about payment and threats. It was terrifying. I called the police, but nothing came of it. When it happened again the next day, I called the leasing office to tell them, but again, nothing was done.” Ana indicated that she had already had trouble with her sleep<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>sleep</primary>
      </indexterm> but has experienced more problems with frequent nighttime awakenings and getting back to sleep. She also noted that she has experienced recurrent nightmares and daydreaming about her traumatic experiences, specifically related to IPV. She finds herself feeling startled by any noise she hears coming from the halls outside her apartment, “I don’t feel safe. I need to move, but I don’t know if I can”.</para>
   <para role="Para">The psychologist listened attentively and structured the interview in an organic manner, taking cues from what Ana was sharing and corroborating and clarifying information noted in the prepared intake. Inquiry about Ana’s current living environment led to a conversation about her relationship status, history, and family dynamics. Ana’s home-based social worker verified information about her current supports: home health aide twice a week for a total of eight hours through her state Medicare benefits and visits from her daughter, who also lives locally, about once a month. Ana shared mixed feelings about her daughter’s visits, indicating that she looks forward to seeing her, “She works two jobs, and she does what she can for me. I sometimes feel bad when she leaves because she looks so exhausted, and sometimes her children don’t help around their apartment. Her<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Her</primary>
      </indexterm> long-time boyfriend died suddenly; she’s on her own now, but my grandchildren take advantage of her. I don’t know why she can’t tell them to contribute. I would if I could, but I’m just as bad.”</para>
   <para role="Para">The psychologist asked about additional changes Ana has noticed regarding her physical and mental health as she ages. Ana recalled her recent visit from the home-based R. N., “Well, she told me that I actually hadn’t taken any medications correctly. I thought I was, but it turns out I was taking my insulin wrong, and I wasn’t taking my water pills. I don’t know. It’s just been too hard to think. I have my son’s death anniversary coming up, and I’m worried about my granddaughter. She is skipping school, and my sister tells me I’m losing my mind.” At this time, Ana increased the rocking motion in her chair. The psychologist checked in with Ana and asked how she was feeling emotionally. The psychologist initiated a grounding exercise, and the back-and-forth rocking decreased. The psychologist reflected on her observation and the distress and impact of what Ana shared.Ana<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Ana</primary>
      </indexterm> acknowledged feeling overwhelmed with her medical and physical problems and wondered, “Why would God keep me here. I wonder what it would be like to not wake up.” The psychologist followed up with a suicide and homicide risk assessment. The psychologist determined that the current ideation did not require further assessment and queried Ana’s values and meaning around end-of-life care. Ana discussed her history with religion and indicated she still finds she is spiritual and will engage in prayer and meditation. She shared a childhood memory of the death of her younger brother and the comfort she received from her father. Ana reflected on receiving comfort through prayer during the time of her son’s unexpected death. She became tearful. The psychologist provided silence and space for Ana to express her emotions. The psychologist thanked Ana for sharing this story and for the profound impact of prayer on her pain.</para>
   <para role="Para">In the last 10 min of the encounter, the psychologist asked Ana about her strengths and what mattered most regarding her overall self. Ana responded, “I love my family. I would say that I would do everything and do anything for them. I want to be able to go out again; I want to visit my sister, my children, and my grandchildren. I don’t go out.” The psychologist summarized the encounter and Ana’s current concerns, areas of difficulty, and overall goals. The psychologist proposed a trauma-informed treatment plan that included targeting pronounced symptoms of fear,avoidance<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>avoidance</primary>
      </indexterm>, hypervigilance, and worry. The psychologist proposed a Stop-Worry protocol validated for older adults with a discussion of incorporating Ana’s values and previously learned tools to increase motivation.</para>
   <para role="Para">Concerning Ana’s memory, the psychologist offered to administer a brief cognitive screener at the following or future session to help better understand her cognitive strengths and areas of weakness. The psychologist also indicated that she would be working closely with Ana’s home-based team to help support her medical concerns. The psychologist reminded Ana about the trial of a medication planner system to aid in medication adherence. The psychologist asked for feedback regarding today’s encounter, including Ana’s expectations of how she thought the session would go and comments on how it went. Ana indicated she felt comfortable with the psychologist and asked if the psychologist would “leave after a year. That’s been my experience, and I feel tired of having to explain myself again and again.” The psychologist validated Ana’s feelings and indicated that their time together would end at some point, depending on many factors, including treatment effectiveness, outcomes, or health changes. At this time, Ana agreed to continue working with the<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>the</primary>
      </indexterm> psychologist and scheduled a follow-up visit.</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">Mrs. Phyllis June is an 82-year-old, black, married, heterosexual, cisgender woman of Buddhist spirituality who uses she/her/hers pronouns. She received Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) services and was referred to the team psychologist by the R. N. after reporting increased difficulties with chronic pain. The R. N. stated that the patient agreed to meet with the team psychologist after learning that there were options for chronic pain treatment that did not involve medication, as she was interested in other forms of pain management.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis role="strong">Chart Review</emphasis>. Per Phyllis’ electronic health record, she has had a history of chronic pain for the last 20 years. Records indicate<indexterm significance="normal">

   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis role="strong">Functional Clinical Interview</emphasis>. Phyllis’ functional clinical interview was conducted at her assisted living facility (ALF), in her kitchen, with her husband nearby in the living room, with her consent. The home appeared to be free of clutter, spacious, with plenty of light. No signs of neglect or other concerns were evident. The home-based primary care psychologist reviewed the limits of confidentiality and her role in Phyllis’ care. The psychologist also outlined the expected procedures for the clinical interview and assessments.</para>
   <para role="Para">Phyllis reported herself to be an 82-year-old, non-disabled, Buddhist, Black, heterosexual, middle class, American, and female. Phyllis reported obtaining her associate’s degree and working in education<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>education</primary>
      </indexterm> for her career. She is married to her husband of 54 years, and they recently moved into an assisted living facility about 45 minutes from the community where they had lived for much of their life. Phyllis expressed gratitude that her three children and five grandchildren are supportive and active in their lives, though they have not been able to visit as much due to the distance between their new ALF.</para>
   <para role="Para">Phyllis reported her chief complaint to be chronic pain. She stated that she has had chronic pain for the last 20 years and found it manageable until her recent move. Phyllis identified her current pain level to be an eight, whereas typically, it is a four or a five. She stated she uses ibuprofen, heating, and ice to manage it. Phyllis shared that walking was a great form of exercise that she could do even when her pain was problematic.</para>
   <para role="Para">She reported no new medications; however, she reported slight dietary changes due to now eating the assisted-living food. She shared that she usually gets adequate sleep and typically feels rested. Phyllis stated she occasionally feels it would be easier if she could just “not wake up” in the morning but denied any<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>any</primary>
      </indexterm>active suicidal ideation, plan, or intent. She cited her protective factors as her family and religion.</para>
   <para role="Para">She denied any past psychiatric history other than feeling very depressed after a miscarriage in her early 30s. Phyllis also denied any recent cognitive changes, history of TBI, or head traumas. She reported no difficulties walking, and the psychologist also observed an independent and steady gait—no clutter in the home or medications that could contribute to fall risks.</para>
   <para role="Para">Phyllis discussed how she used to be much more active around the home and in her community until her recent move. She stated that she and her husband attended many social events at the senior center, played cards, and enjoyed connection with their religious community. She stated that she and her husband have maintained their intimacy satisfactorily. Phyllis denied any financial or legal concerns. Phyllis denied any identity stressors. However, upon asking the “miracle question” - if you could engage in therapy and have things be exactly how you want them to be, what would your life look like? She stated that she would have her ALF be in her long-time community or bring her<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>her</primary>
      </indexterm>community to the ALF.</para>
   <para role="Para">Upon asking more open-ended questions, such as how her community contributed to her pain levels, Phyllis stated that she was more active and comfortable with them because they shared the same racial identity as her and that at the ALF she and her husband are relatively the only black individuals at the facility. Phyllis shared that she feels out of place and that she does not attend the social events or exercise classes held at the facility because of her minority status, which she knows would help her pain levels. She identified this as a barrier to change and stated she is open to discussing more in therapy.</para>
   <para role="Para">After the interview, the writer reflected appreciation for Phyllis’ disclosures. Though typically, a protocol of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) would be recommended, it became evident that<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>that</primary>
      </indexterm> Phyllis is aware of how her behavioral activation contributes to her chronic pain and that her most significant source of stress and barrier is her experience of isolation as an individual with a minority identity in her new ALF. Consequently, the writer suggested that the next session focus on building rapport, continuing to discuss Phyllis’ experience, and developing a gradual exposure hierarchy. As with functional care settings, the psychologist assigned a small task: for Phyllis to spend time between sessions identifying activities around the ALF that she may enjoy, even if she does not wish<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>wish</primary>
      </indexterm>to do them just yet.</para>
