   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">As discussed elsewhere, it is helpful to gather information from key informants when determining a bipolar diagnosis, such as family members or other healthcare providers involved in their care. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing bipolar disorders as patients may lack insight into the extent of impairment or change in behavior they are experiencing during manic or hypomanic episodes. Indeed, a diagnosis of hypomania requires that others have observed changes in mood and functioning<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>functioning</primary>
      </indexterm>. Given the lack of marked impairment seen in bipolar II disorder and patients’ tendency to present in a depressive episode, it can be particularly difficult to identify a history of hypomanic episodes (Angst et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). However, this information is critical to determining an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, assessors should be sure to always assess for a history of hypomanic or manic symptoms when a patient presents with depression. Utilizing scales specific to the diagnosis of hypomania, such as the HCL-32, can be helpful in identifying more nuanced behaviors that may be indicative of bipolar II disorder, such as being more social or traveling more than usual. As detailed in the diagnostic criteria section, symptoms of mania and hypomania can be induced by certain recreational and prescription drugs as well as by certain medical conditions; therefore, it is very important to obtain a thorough medical history of the patient including any recent diagnoses or medication changes. Finally, given that bipolar disorder has a strong genetic component, it is helpful to gather a family history of psychiatric disorders that may inform the diagnostic process.</para>
