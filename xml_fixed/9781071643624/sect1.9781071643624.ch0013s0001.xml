The development of a DD has most consistently been associated with antecedent trauma, particularly when exposure happens repeatedly in childhood (Dalenberg et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2012</phrase>
      </emphasis>, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>). To further understand DDs, we begin by presenting common symptoms, followed by a discussion of the current diagnostic criteria, prevalence, and difficulties with accurate diagnosis. Further, we discuss strategies for gathering information, including interviews, psychological measures (e. g., self-report and performance-based), and behavioral observations. We conclude with factors to consider when ruling out other diagnoses with similar presentations, such as schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder.</para>

      <para role="Para">The 4D model (Frewen &amp; Lanius,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>) conceptualizes dissociation as existing on a continuum, with common, nonpathological experiences (e. g., flow, highway hypnosis) on one end and maladaptive experiences that may indicate the presence of a DD on the other. Research supports both ideas<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>ideas</primary>
         </indexterm> and has identified a core group of pathological dissociative experiences (Bernstein &amp; Putnam, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1986</phrase>
         </emphasis>), as well as a continuum of less problematic shifts in consciousness. Specifically, studies have found the taxon differentiates between those who have a chronic or persistent dissociative pattern that interferes with functioning, whereas a dissociative continuum is applicable to those without a DD who experience fluctuations in consciousness (see Frewen &amp; Lanius, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>, for a review).</para>
      <para role="Para">Although dissociative symptoms are most commonly related to trauma, research suggests they occur in a variety<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>variety</primary>
         </indexterm> of disorders such as somatic, substance use, and psychotic disorders. The most severe dissociation is found among individuals with trauma and attachment-related disorders (PTSD, borderline personality disorder) and particularly dissociative identity disorder (DID) (Lyssenko et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Because chronic dissociation can interfere with information retention and treatment engagement (Lanius et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>), it is important to assess these symptoms regardless of treatment setting or presenting problem. Moreover, misdiagnosed and untreated DDs can result in significant consequences to the individual (i. e., functional impairment, disability, poorer physical health, likelihood of revictimization, and even death) and society (i. e., increased social services<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>services</primary>
         </indexterm>needs, hospitalization/healthcare costs) (Boyer et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

According to a summary of epidemiological research, the prevalence in clinical settings is approximately 10% (inpatient range 4.3–40.8%, outpatient range 12–34.9%), with half of those individuals suffering from DID (reviewed in Sar, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although research has shown DDs are found cross-culturally, with prevalence rates of more than 5% in a number of countries (see Dorahy et al., 2000 for a review), limited training in identification of dissociation (Leonard &amp; Tiller, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>), and differences in conceptualization and measurement are factors that may affect the prevalence rates (Sar, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Of note, much of the DD research has focused on DID because it causes the most significant disruptions in functioning. In community samples<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>samples</primary>
         </indexterm>, the prevalence rate of DID is approximately 1–3% (Dorahy et al., 2000; ISSTD et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>), indicating that this most severe form of DD is about as common as bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and more common than schizophrenia. White<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> and colleagues (<emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>) also found a 38.1% prevalence rate of people diagnosed with the DPTSD. Such high prevalence rates suggest that all individuals seeking psychological treatment should be routinely assessed for<indexterm significance="normal">
