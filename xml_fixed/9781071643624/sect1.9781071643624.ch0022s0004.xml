   <title>Case Illustration</title>
   <para role="Para">We illustrate several key components of interviewing older adults in the following case which focuses on Mr. H., a Black, 70-year-old, cisgender, gay man referred by his primary care provider for evaluation of reported memory complaints following a fall 7 months prior in which he hit the back of his head and suffered a concussion.</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0022s0004s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Clinical Interview</title>
      <para role="Para">Mr. H was evaluated by a psychologist in an outpatient integrated primary care team. He was accompanied by his partner and expressed that he would like him to be in the room during the interview. The examiner began by asking Mr. H to elaborate on his cognitive complaints that prompted the referral. He reported that he has been having difficulty remembering words, appointments, and certain aspects of his history, often remembering details “much later” after being asked. He characterized his memory as having “good days and bad days” over the last 5 months. Mr. H generally denied difficulty with ADLS or IADLS. His partner indicated that he took over cooking and that Mr. H needs reminders to pay the bills.</para>
      <para role="Para">In discussing his history, Mr. H revealed that he tripped on a rug in his building 7 months ago, resulting in a fall and concussion. Immediately following the fall, he experienced dizziness, blurred vision, and headaches. He was evaluated by a physician at urgent care, who diagnosed him with a concussion. The physician recommended that Mr. H rest and limit intense physical activity until his symptoms improved, monitor himself for worsening symptoms, and take acetaminophen to manage his headaches. Per Mr. H, his<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>his</primary>
         </indexterm> memory loss began 2 months after the fall and he developed posttraumatic chronic pain from the incident. He became tearful as he recounted these details, telling the examiner that he worried he would be diagnosed with dementia and lose his ability to live independently. The examiner offered an empathic response and emphasized that the purpose of this interview is to better understand his problems and identify potential interventions that will support his goal of preserving autonomy as much as possible.</para>
      <para role="Para">When prompted for mood and anxiety symptoms in recent weeks, Mr. H endorsed frequent crying, difficulty sleeping, appetite loss, fatigue, restlessness, nervousness, and feeling frightened about the future. Apart from his psychological symptoms over the past several months, Mr. H experienced severe insomnia and anxiety 10 years ago following a prostate cancer diagnosis. This prompted him to visit a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed him sertraline. Around this time<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>time</primary>
         </indexterm>, he additionally attended individual psychotherapy and couples therapy with his partner; they noted they sought support in navigating the impacts on their relationship, including intimacy. He reported that the medication and therapy sessions were helpful to him and that he stopped all treatments after about 1 year, following reduced distress. Mr. H denied current engagement in mental health treatment, including medications and/or therapy. He denied any current or past suicidal ideation. The examiner also assessed for recreational drug and alcohol use, given the known impact of substance use on cognition. Mr. H reported that, in the past, he struggled with alcohol abuse and sought treatment after meeting his partner, with consistent sobriety for the last 24 years. Mr. H stated that he had never taken any other drugs, including marijuana. He noted that he used to smoke cigarettes but stopped 10 years ago. He reported drinking two cups of caffeinated coffee daily. In terms of additional medical history, Mr. H reported that he received radiation therapy at age 60 for prostate cancer and hormone<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>hormone</primary>
         </indexterm> treatment for two more years; he has been in remission since then. Mr. H denied any history of head injury beyond the concussion associated with his recent fall and was not aware of a history of dementia in his family.</para>
      <para role="Para">Finally, the examiner asked about Mr. H’s social history. Mr. H was born and raised in a rural area in the United States. Though he did not experience learning difficulties in school, he described having had difficulties with his attention. After treatment for alcohol use disorder, Mr. H returned to college to earn his Bachelor’s degree. He reported that most for his career he was employed in foster care administrative roles, until he retired 5 years ago. Mr. H currently lives with his partner of 26 years and their 20-year-old niece in a large city. They married after Mr. H completed prostate cancer treatment as he felt this was a “wake-up call” to the fact that they are getting older and may need more medical<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>medical</primary>
         </indexterm> care. He described worrying about how they might be treated as a gay couple if they were not legally married.</para>

      <title>Behavioral Observations</title>
      <para role="Para">The examiner observed that over the two sessions she met with Mr. H, he arrived on time and presented as well-related, pleasant, and anxious. Mr. H appeared appropriately dressed and well-groomed. His speech was of normal rhythm and volume, although he paused at times when trying to recall certain details of his past. Following the clinical interview, the examiner administered the 3 MS as a screening test for dementia on which Mr. H scored 86/100, falling in the tenth percentile relative to other members<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>members</primary>
         </indexterm> of his age group and education level. Though he was agreeable to taking the test, he expressed frustration and worry about his cognition several times while taking it, particularly during tasks of memory and language. The GDS-15 and GAD-7 were also administered to gain more insight into his anxiety and depressive symptoms and scores were 12/15 and 20/21, respectively, suggesting significant depression and anxiety.</para>
      <para role="Para">After closing the evaluation, the examiner discussed her initial impressions and recommendations with Mr. H and his partner. She explained that his cognitive changes from his optimal abilities were likely to be driven<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>driven</primary>
         </indexterm>by his significant anxiety and depression symptoms, suggestive of current major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. His performance on the 3 MS was suggestive of possible minor neurocognitive disorder with his difficulty on some cognitive tasks appearing to be exacerbated by his self-doubt, frustration, anxiety, and pain. The clinician provided brief psychoeducation on the relationship between cognitive performance, emotional symptoms, and chronic pain and explained that addressing his anxiety and depression through psychotherapy may be helpful. She suggested he repeat cognitive screening in a year following this intervention to clarify any additional or persistent cognitive difficulties.</para>

      <title>Key Takeaways</title>
      <para role="Para">In addition to cognitive screening, older adults presenting with subjective cognitive complaints should be evaluated for emotional symptoms that may be negatively impacting cognition. Diagnostically, a common symptom of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder is difficulty concentrating. This can be associated with difficulties in learning, prompting perceived memory changes. It is important to assess for medical factors that may impact emotional and cognitive complaints. Chronic pain is more common among older adults than in younger adults, and can prompt difficulty concentrating, as well as risk for anxiety and depression. Certain medications (e. g., select muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, and sleep aids) and illicit substances can also impact cognition. Stressors such as coping with a cancer diagnosis and navigating relationship changes can impact emotional states and should be considered as part of a holistic picture in an older adult reporting memory changes. Cognitive screening either 6 months or a year after this initial assessment would be recommended for Mr. H if he still reported cognitive problems after intervention for his mood. With the patient’s consent, the delivery of recommendations and psychoeducation with a caregiver or family member present can be helpful.</para>
