   <title>Recommendations for Formal Assessment</title>
   <para role="Para">In addition to interviewing<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>interviewing</primary>
      </indexterm>and observing children, several standardized assessment tools can complement the evaluation by providing quantitative information in varying domains. If diagnostic accuracy is the goal, such standardized tools are preferable. Assessment tools include those designed to evaluate cognitive abilities, academic achievement, and behavior rating scales that screen for a variety of problems (i. e., wide band scales) and those that assess specific symptom domains (i. e., narrow band assessment scales). If the goal is diagnostic accuracy, it is recommended that the clinician has good knowledge of the DSM-5-TR and utilizes either a semi-structured or structured interview.</para>
   <para role="Para">Cognitive and achievement measures are utilized primarily in the process of psychoeducational evaluation. Cognitive assessments provide information about a child’s intellectual functioning, often relative<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>relative</primary>
      </indexterm> to performance in academic domains, and are important for establishing diagnoses related to neurodevelopmental concerns. Commonly used cognitive measures include the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-5; Wechsler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>), the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV; Wechsler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2012</phrase>
      </emphasis>), and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II-NU; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Cognitive ability measures are often used in conjunction with measures of academic achievement to determine whether there is a discrepancy between a child’s ability (i. e., IQ) and achievement. Such information can be gathered by administering achievement measures such as the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement (WJ-V ACH; Schrank et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2025</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-IV; Wechsler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). These tools are typically necessary for the diagnosis of a specific learning disorder.</para>
   <para role="Para">Personality assessment can<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>can</primary>
      </indexterm> be used to obtain data on unobservable or internal psychological processes that are not thought to be context-dependent or time bound, which may be the case for symptoms of a mental disorder. The most widely known tool for personality assessment in youth is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory for Adolescents Restructured Form (MMPI-A-RF; Archer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>), which is considered a multidimensional assessment tool with 48 empirically validated subscales (e. g., Anxiety, Cynicism, Negative Peer Influence). Such tools often require extensive training to interpret, are most appropriate for older youth, and involve several hundred questions.</para>
   <para role="Para">Broad measures that assess children’s functioning across multiple domains and include multiple subscales are often<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>often</primary>
      </indexterm> important for comprehensive screening in clinical settings. Examples of such tools include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2001</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>3</primary>
      </indexterm>; Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Both the CBCL and BASC-3 include preschool, school age, adolescent, and young adult versions of the parent report measure, as well as corresponding teacher-report forms. In addition, self-report versions of the tools are available for older children (ages 8 and older for the BASC-3, ages 11 and older for the CBCL), as well as forms for conducting behavioral observations of children. Broad measures can be a useful strategy for obtaining information from teachers and for confirming information obtained through the diagnostic interview. In addition, such tools can be used to screen for other disorders that may not have been heavily discussed during the clinical interview.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      Narrow-band assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Narrow-band assessment</primary>
      </indexterm>tools are those that measure specific sets of symptoms or clinical phenomena. Such tools are useful for quantifying the presence of symptoms within a specific problem area, measuring specific information about problem severity, and/or tracking symptom change over the course of treatment (i. e., progress monitoring). A common example of such a tool is the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADRS; Wolraich et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>), which is a rating scale used to assess symptoms of ADHD<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>ADHD</primary>
      </indexterm> in children ages 6–12 and screen for other externalizing disorders. The measure includes both a parent and teacher version. A follow-up form to assess symptom change and side effects of medication is also available. Another example of a narrow-band assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>narrow-band assessment</primary>
      </indexterm> tool is the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2000</phrase>
      </emphasis>), which is a questionnaire that assesses<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>assesses</primary>
      </indexterm> internalizing disorders, including anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The RCADS<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>RCADS</primary>

      <title>Standardized Interview Formats</title>
      <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">
         Structured interviews<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Structured interviews</primary>
         </indexterm> are those interviews with predetermined question format and order, as well as specific follow-up questions based on responses obtained. These interviews are advantageous in research settings and settings where clinician variability and bias need to be reduced. While they may reduce the time required to completing intake interviews, additional questions may be necessary for obtaining idiographic information to personalize treatment. Several widely available structured interviews for children and their caregivers are detailed below.</para>
      <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Adolescents</primary>
         </indexterm> (MINI-Kid; Sheehan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is a structured diagnostic interview to assess the presence of DSM-5 diagnoses in children and adolescents ages 6–17. It assesses the 30 most common and clinically relevant diagnoses in children and adolescents. The MINI-Kid was designed as a more efficient diagnostic tool for clinical and research settings and uses a branching format to determine which items must be administered. It is available in a standard child version, which can be administered to the child and caregiver<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>caregiver</primary>
         </indexterm> together, with the questions directed to the child while the caregiver is asked to respond only when they believe the child has not provided accurate information. The parent version of the interview can be used when the caregiver is interviewed alone about the child. In addition, a screening version of the tool is available to facilitate shorter interviews by allowing the clinician to determine which<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>which</primary>
         </indexterm> additional sections of the MINI to administer. Where additional detail is needed, several non-standard versions are available for use, including the MINI-Kid for Psychotic Disorders Studies, the MINI Kid with Tobacco Use Disorder Module, and the MINI-Kid for Suicidality Disorders Studies. To track treatment progress over time, the MINI-Kid Tracking version converts yes/no responses into dimensional options to assess the severity of each symptom.</para>
      <para role="Para">Although no standardized training is offered in the MINI-Kid, individuals with clinical training can use the tool after a brief session of instruction in the measure. For those with less clinical experience, more extensive training is required. The MINI-Kid has been shown to be highly concordant with other semi-structured interview tools that require additional time to administer (i. e., Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children—Present and Lifetime Version; K-SADS-PL; Sheehan et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, concordance of the MINI-Kid and K-SADS-PL in psychotic<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>psychotic</primary>
         </indexterm>disorders was shown to be more variable. The interview’s ability to detect the presence of disorder (i. e., sensitivity) was adequate for 15 of 20 individual disorders in the DSM-IV version of the interview. In addition, the MINI-Kid had good ability to detect those without diagnoses (i. e., specificity) for all 20 diagnoses in the DSM-IV version of the measure. More recently, psychometrics studies revisiting the test-retest reliability of the MINI-Kid found that although the reliability values were lower than in the initial psychometrics study (Sheehan et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>), they still fell in the achievable and acceptable range and were higher than the average reliability values from a summary of 15 studies across various other assessment tools (Duncan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Boyle et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The latest version of the assessment, the MINI-Kid English Version 7.0.2, has been revised to parallel changes made to the DSM-5; alongside it, the Adolescent MINI Kid for Suicidality Disorders Studies (MINI-Kid-SD; Sheehan &amp; Giddens, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>) has been released as an adjunct to the standard MINI-Kid modules<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>modules</primary>
         </indexterm>to facilitate differentiation between suicidality disorder phenotypes (e. g., Impulse Attack Suicidality Disorder, Psychotic Suicidality Disorder).</para>
      <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">
         Semi-structured interviews<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Semi-structured interviews</primary>
         </indexterm> can be utilized as a guideline for clinical interviewing. Such interviews include predetermined questions that may serve as a suggestion for interviewers, or as a basis for continued follow-up questions. While semi-structured interviews may reduce variability and clinician bias, the flexibility conferred by such an approach may require additional training to reach reliability and may further extend the time required for administration. Several semi-structured interview tools are reviewed next.</para>
      <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">The Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and OCD and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Child and Adolescent Version (DIAMOND-KID; Tolin et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is a semi-structured<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>semi-structured</primary>
         </indexterm> interview designed for children and adolescents, which derives from the adult DIAMOND assessment (Tolin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The DIAMOND-KID relies on developmentally appropriate language and, occasionally, other informants’ input to screen for DSM-5 diagnoses in youth ages 6–17. This clinical interview also includes over 40 clinically relevant diagnoses to examine differential diagnoses and asses a wider range of conditions. The DIAMOND-KID can be administered to the child alone, or to the child with a caregiver<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>caregiver</primary>
         </indexterm> present; before each diagnostic section, guidance is provided as to who is the best source of information. Currently, the DIAMOND-KID is offered in English, Arabic, Spanish, and Hebrew, with ongoing efforts to translate it into additional languages.</para>
      <para role="Para">The DIAMOND-KID<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>DIAMOND-KID</primary>
         </indexterm> was designed as a more efficient diagnostic tool for clinical and research settings that prioritizes a thorough understanding of symptomatology while still adhering to a relatively short administration time. This is achieved through proposed clarifying questions that probe at symptoms endorsed, distress and impairment questions that efficiently rule out subclinical symptoms, and information on common differential diagnoses, adapted from the DSM-5, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Because of the DIAMOND-KID’s semi-structured nature, clinicians are given the liberty to determine when further questioning is needed and which sections of the interview to administer. Before the interview, clinicians can provide clients or caregivers with a DIAMOND-KID screening form. This<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>This</primary>
         </indexterm> can assist in identifying main concerns, potentially reducing the duration of the assessment. By employing “skip” rules, where clinicians advance to the next diagnosis if the client does not meet necessary criteria, the assessment can typically be administered to most patients in about 1 h. When examining psychometrics, the DIAMOND-KID demonstrated strong reliability with very good to excellent internal consistency according to the standards set by DSM-5 field trials (Tolin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Clarke et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is worth noting that interrater reliability for some internalizing disorders was found questionable in youth (Tolin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>), possibly due to reliance on specific<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> time frames for youth diagnoses.</para>
      <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; Chambers et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>) is<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>is</primary>
         </indexterm> a semi-structured interview, appropriate for children and adolescents ages 6–18 years old. Currently, only the Present/Lifetime version of the interview (K-SADS-PL DSM-5; Kaufman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and the web-based computerized versions of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADS-COMP; Townsend et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>) are updated for DSM-5 criteria. The K-SADS-PL assesses the presence of symptoms over the course of the child’s lifetime and at the time of the interview. Consistent with dimensional measures available in the DSM-5, the updated K-SADS-PL includes crosscutting dimensional rating scales completed by the caregiver and the child prior to the interview, which can be utilized to inform diagnosis and case conceptualization. The interview includes modules which assess for affective disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorders</primary>
         </indexterm>, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, stress-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders (e. g., tic disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder). It also includes a 10- to 15-min unstructured section to facilitate rapport building and obtain information about the presenting concerns. A set of screening interview questions are utilized to survey the presence of primary symptoms for all diagnoses. Based on symptoms endorsed, the appropriate interview supplements are then administered to the caregiver and/or the child.</para>
      <para role="Para">Within the interview<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>interview</primary>
         </indexterm>, probes to facilitate rating of items are provided as guidelines to the clinician, though these are not intended to be read verbatim. Once sufficient information for the item has been obtained, symptoms are rated on a 0 to 3 scale by the clinician, with 0 indicating no information and 3 indicating that the symptom meets or exceeds threshold (Kaufman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Final diagnoses are determined based on child and caregiver ratings, and it is recommended that interviewers use clinical judgment when discrepancies between caregiver and child report are present.</para>
      <para role="Para">In total, the interview is estimated to take two and a half hours for both the child and caregiver portion. Research training for the measure involves a two-day didactic training followed by post-training reliability checks and consultation. Although psychometric data is not yet available for the DSM-5<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>version</primary>
         </indexterm> of the K-SADS-PL in English, psychometric data on the Turkish DSM-5 adaptation, as well as the Japanese DSM-5 adaptation, have shown very good interrater reliability and good construct validity (Ünal et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Nishiyama et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>

An Icelandic version of the K-SADS-PL DSM-5 was studied for the test-retest validity of the updated assessment; most disorders demonstrated excellent reliability except for chronic motor or vocal tic disorder which showed poor reliability (Hannesson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, psychometric data on the KSADS-COMP reported that the computerized version had a strong convergent validity, and high interrater reliability for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and<indexterm significance="normal">

         </emphasis>), is a commonly used semi-structured interview used for differential diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders, which also screens for other disorders and comorbidities. The interview can be administered to children ages 6–18 years old and their caregivers and has recently been updated for the DSM-5. Given the semi-structured format, questions provided are considered by the authors to be guidelines and are not required to be read verbatim. Additional phrasing suggestions for adjusting questions to the child’s developmental level are also provided in the text. Each section of the interview includes a question to assess impairment, rated from 0 to 8 (8 being the highest level of impairment); impairment ratings are obtained from the caregiver and child separately. Although guidelines are available for establishing composite<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> by the clinician. It is recommended that interviewers review composite diagnoses and assign CSRs with a consensus team or supervisor. Seeing as the ADIS-5-C/P is a recent update, documentation of its translations is not yet available. However, the previous version, ADIS-IV-C/P (Silverman &amp; Albano, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
