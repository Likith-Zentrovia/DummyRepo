   <title>Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">When assessing and diagnosing<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>diagnosing</primary>
      </indexterm> children, it is essential to consider the child in context, understanding the systems and environments where they interact, as well as the cultural and developmental context unique to the individual. First, an understanding of developmental milestones and functioning across childhood is essential for any competent clinician working with children. Becoming familiar with development from early childhood through late adolescence or early adulthood is important in establishing a baseline for typical functioning against which to compare children whose functioning may be impaired by presenting concerns. Without such an understanding, it is difficult to determine whether a child’s behavior or functioning is indicative of psychopathology. For example, many young children present with fears of the dark, which is considered developmentally appropriate during early childhood and therefore would not be deemed pathological, particularly in situations where this fear did not result in significant impairment. On the other hand, an adolescent<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>adolescent</primary>
      </indexterm>afraid of the dark who requires a caregiver to accompany them to the bathroom at night demonstrates a developmentally atypical fear, which may be causing impairment in the home.</para>
   <para role="Para">Cultural considerations are equally important in assessing developmental appropriateness, as cultural factors can influence perceptions of what is deemed appropriate. For example, studies suggest cultural and ethnic variations in maternal expectations of developmental milestones, with some cultures tending to anticipate their children achieving personal and social milestones at later stages or reporting socio-communication concerns at a lower rate than other cultural groups; this, in turn, directly affects how clinicians administer and conceptualize diagnostic interviews (Zuckerman et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Many clinicians receive limited exposure to typically developing children or children outside of clinical settings. Therefore, it is wise for clinicians to seek opportunities to interact with youth<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>youth</primary>
      </indexterm> of varying ages in various contexts including schools, camps, or community organizations.</para>
   <para role="Para">In addition to understanding children’s development, clinicians must consider the child’s geo-social context. This includes local and regional culture—the community and school environment—as well as cultural and racial/ethnic issues that may inform the diagnostic assessment. Understanding local and community norms can be helpful for determining the impact of psychopathology on functioning. For example, in an urban environment, it may be quite common for older children and adolescents to take public transportation independently; a child who refuses to take public transportation due to anxiety suggests some level of impairment. A child in a rural or suburban community may rely on caregivers for transportation and would not be considered impaired by their avoidance of public transportation.</para>
   <para role="Para">Factors such as race, ethnicity, culture, and gender significantly influence the diagnostic process. Symptom experience and<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>and</primary>
      </indexterm>expression are shaped by language, culture, and social context (Kirmayer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). During a clinical interview, verbal comprehension issues or linguistic misunderstandings between client and interviewer can directly impact clinical decisions. Cultural differences and family values may affect how families convey presenting concerns and symptoms. For instance, some clients may convey emotional distress by describing physical sensations that may not directly correspond with diagnostic criteria reliant on endorsement of specific emotional states; this may be the case for some clients of ethnic or racial groups where somatic symptoms are a more widely accepted or common form of expressing<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>expressing</primary>
      </indexterm> psychological discomfort (Dunlop et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Awareness of culturally specific concerns is crucial in understanding how some families may perceive the diagnostic process and the types of information or services they seek. For example, in families or cultures where mental health care is heavily stigmatized or not trusted due to a history of racial and ethnic injustice, caregivers may<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>may</primary>
      </indexterm> present seeking confirmation that a child does <emphasis>not</emphasis> have a diagnosis, or they may react defensively to receiving a formal diagnosis. Cultural values may also inform the attributions families and clinicians make for a child’s behavior or presenting symptoms. Some symptoms that the clinician considers problematic, or evidence of a disorder, may be thought of by the family as typical within the cultural or family context. For instance, in Western clinical settings, assertiveness and lack of externalized anxiety are often valued, but these norms may not align with non-Western cultures, where self-restraint and modest anxious social behavior may be normative (Okazaki et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2002</phrase>
      </emphasis>). While such behaviors may be seen as socially appropriate within their respective cultural contexts, a Western clinician might misinterpret them as signs of social or interpersonal deficits, potentially suggesting psychopathology.</para>
   <para role="Para">It is important for clinicians to be mindful that most assessment instruments have been developed and normed within largely<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>largely</primary>
      </indexterm> white and Western samples. Keeping this in mind allows the clinician to more appropriately assess issues of diversity that may not be captured by structured or norm-referenced assessment tools. Rather than establishing preconceived boundaries and expectations for cultural differences, clinicians should ask openly about the role of culture and diversity during the diagnostic interview process. This can be done in an interview format by using tools like the DSM-5-TR’s Cultural Formulation Interview (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>) or by simply asking the child and/or caregiver how they feel their culture or values may impact current concerns or treatment. In addition, clinicians should be attuned to historic as well as contemporary issues of culture and diversity that may<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>may</primary>
      </indexterm>be embedded within the interview responses. Further information on cultural sensitivity and multicultural competence within diagnostic interviewing, as well as a framework for how clinicians can consider this in practice, is outlined by Johnson<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Johnson</primary>
      </indexterm> and Tucker<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Tucker</primary>
      </indexterm> (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2008</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Some additional resources for clinicians looking to establish a strong foundation on cultural considerations are the APA’s Multicultural Guidelines (American Psychological Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and the APA’s Handbook of Multicultural Psychology (Leong et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">During a diagnostic interview, concerns about gender roles and norms, along with details about sexual and gender identity, may arise. It is crucial for clinicians to handle this sensitive personal information with care and to be mindful of its potential relevance when developing the case conceptualization. To effectively tailor treatment and conduct a comprehensive interview, clinicians must consider the unique experiences of clients who identify with marginalized communities, such as LGBTQIA+<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>youth</primary>
      </indexterm>, young girls, and/or youth of color. For instance, sexual and gender minority youth often face unique stressors, such as a persistent fear of rejection based on their identity or chronic feelings of isolation from concealing their identity from family and friends (Hendricks &amp; Testa, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2012</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Herman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Wanta et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Clinicians should consider these factors when assessing whether a child’s anxiety or responses are excessive relative to their specific experiences with discrimination at home or school. Whenever asking about sexuality, gender identity, and/or gender discrimination (i. e., sexism, transphobia), clinicians should make extra efforts to respect the child’s privacy and honor any preferred pronouns or name provided by the child. Creating an affirming and respectful environment during the diagnostic interview is<emphasis>essential</emphasis> for building rapport, fostering trust, and increasing diagnostic accuracy.</para>
   <para role="Para">Finally, clinicians must be<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>be</primary>
      </indexterm> aware that issues of diversity extend beyond race, religion, and gender. Even <emphasis>within</emphasis> cultural groups, there may be differences in values or experiences that are relevant to the diagnostic process. Broad categories like race and gender may not capture the varied experiences of children and their caregivers. It is important to consider the range of identities and experiences one child may have. Socioeconomic status, gender identity, sexual identity, disability status, and race/ethnicity are especially relevant to mental health, as the experience of living in poverty and/or being part of a marginalized or minority group may impose unique stressors for children and families. Clinicians must also develop an understanding of how these identities and experiences intersect for the individual or the family, and how this might inform<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> the diagnosis or interview process.</para>
