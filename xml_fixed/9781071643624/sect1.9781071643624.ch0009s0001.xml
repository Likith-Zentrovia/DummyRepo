   <title>Description of the Disorders</title>
   <para role="Para">Bipolar and related disorders are complex, chronic conditions characterized by periods of significantly depressed and elevated mood. Individuals with bipolar disorder experience marked impairments in occupational and interpersonal functioning, and these difficulties have been shown to persist despite clinical remission in approximately half of the diagnosed population (Sanchez-Moreno et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2009</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Indeed, bipolar disorder ranks as the overall ninth leading cause of disability worldwide (World Health Organization, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2001</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and the sixth leading cause of disability in individuals aged 10 to 24 years worldwide (Gore et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2011</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Most patients with bipolar disorder will have at least one other comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, with anxiety disorders, substance use disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>disorders</primary>
      </indexterm>, personality disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders being highly prevalent (Krishnan, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The presence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>diagnoses</primary>
      </indexterm> can contribute to poorer illness outcomes (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Bauer et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>), and the use of substances can intensify manic symptoms (Rowland &amp; Marwaha, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Bipolar disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Bipolar disorder</primary>
      </indexterm> is also associated with a higher prevalence of medical conditions, often leading to premature mortality (Chan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Rates of death by suicide among individuals<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>individuals</primary>
      </indexterm> with bipolar disorder are between 30 and 60 times that of the general population (Miller &amp; Black, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Of those individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>bipolar disorder</primary>
      </indexterm>, 25–50% will attempt suicide within their lifetime (Baldessarini et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2006</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Dong et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Jamison, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2000</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and 15–20% of individuals with bipolar disorder will die by suicide, with a greater risk of death in individuals that have untreated bipolar disorder (Baldessarini et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2006</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Dome et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Dong et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Individuals with bipolar II are at a higher risk of suicide than those diagnosed with bipolar I (Plans et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). There are no significant differences in the prevalence of suicidal ideation between males and females with bipolar disorder (Hu et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>), but lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts is higher in females than males (Dong et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Tondo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and higher in rapid cycling bipolar disorder than non-rapid cycling bipolar disorder (Dong et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Despite a higher prevalence of suicide attempts in females<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>females</primary>
      </indexterm>, males with bipolar disorder exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of suicide-related deaths (Hu et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>) as men with bipolar often use more lethal means of suicide (Tondo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Pompili et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2009</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Several additional demographic and socioeconomic-related factors are associated with increased rates of completed suicide among people with bipolar disorder including being White, being divorced, living alone, and being under age 35 or over age 75 (Plans et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Additionally, individuals who experience bipolar disorder onset at a younger age are at an increased risk of a future suicide attempt (Schaffer et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">
      Bipolar disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Bipolar disorder</primary>
      </indexterm> has a strong genetic component (Chen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>), but environmental influences such as stress or trauma may impact illness onset and severity (Aldinger &amp; Schulze, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Stressful life events that can contribute to bipolar disorder onset or course include childbirth, divorce, unemployment, or loss of a parent early in life (Rowland &amp; Marwaha, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). In addition to the connection between stressful life events and the lifetime development of bipolar disorder, 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder report at least one stressful event before a manic or depressive episode in the past 6 months, further suggesting the strong role that stress plays in the development and manifestation of bipolar disorder and related episodes (Rybakowski, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Between 20 and 30% of patients with major depressive disorder transition to bipolar disorder within 3 years. Because of this, it is imperative that clinicians are acutely aware of the possibility of this transition (Kessing et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Mc Intyre et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The DSM-5 Text Revision (TR) includes the following seven diagnoses under the category of Bipolar and Related Disorders: bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="SimplePara">Note. Adapted from the DSM-5-TR</para>
      <para role="Para">Patients experiencing mania act in ways that are uncharacteristic of their typical behavior, such as taking on an unrealistic number of work tasks or creative ventures, engaging in risky sexual behavior, or impulsively spending large amounts of money. Manic episodes must also cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or involve psychotic features or hospitalization<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>hospitalization</primary>
         </indexterm>. Psychosis during mania may involve religious or grandiose delusions, such as that the individual is invincible or has special powers. Importantly, while bipolar I disorder is often characterized by a history of both manic and major depressive episodes, the experience of depressive episodes is <emphasis>not required</emphasis> to receive a bipolar I diagnosis. That being said, mania-only bipolar disorder is relatively rare, accounting for 5 to 28% of bipolar diagnoses based on various estimates (Perugi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>). To diagnose bipolar I disorder, the clinician must confirm that the manic episode is not better attributed to a schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>

      <para role="Para">The lifetime prevalence rate for bipolar I disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>bipolar I disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> has been estimated at approximately 1% in the United States (Clemente et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and up to 2.4% globally (Merikangas et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These rates are approximately equivalent between men and women (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The mean age of onset reported in the literature ranges from 18 to 25 years old with a smaller subset of the population being diagnosed in midlife (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

Differences have been identified between these two subgroups, such that earlier age of onset is associated with greater illness severity, family history of bipolar disorder, and increased risk of suicide attempts compared to those in the older onset group (Sherazi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         Bipolar II disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Bipolar II disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> is characterized by the presence of both <emphasis>hypomanic episodes</emphasis> and major depressive episodes. Hypomanic episodes differ from manic episodes in their severity and may differ in their length as well. Specifically, hypomania is characterized by at least four consecutive days of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood along with increased activity or energy and three additional symptoms (see Table <emphasis role="InternalRef">
            <phrase>7.1</phrase>
         </emphasis>), or four symptoms if presenting with irritable mood only. Hypomanic episodes involve an unequivocal, uncharacteristic, and observable change in functioning in the patient, but not to the point of causing marked impairment or necessitating hospitalization. However, individuals with bipolar II disorder must have a history of at least one major depressive episode. Individuals with bipolar II disorder are more likely to present to treatment during a depressive episode versus a period of hypomania; given the lack of impairment associated with hypomania, they often do not find fault with these symptoms.</para>
      <para role="Para">It is important to note that bipolar II disorder is not a milder version of bipolar I disorder. While individuals with bipolar II disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>bipolar II disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> do not experience the impairment of mania, they often experience longer and more frequent depressive episodes as compared to bipolar I, which significantly impacts functioning (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Indeed, the functional impairment observed in bipolar disorder has largely been attributed to the experience of depressive symptoms versus manic or hypomanic symptoms (Bauer et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2001</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Like bipolar I, diagnosing bipolar II requires that the hypomanic and major depressive episodes are not better attributed to schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The lifetime prevalence of bipolar II disorder is 0.4% (Merikangas et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>) to 1.57% (Clemente et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The average age of onset is during the mid-20s and is somewhat later than that observed in bipolar I disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorder</primary>
         </indexterm>. Bipolar II may be more prevalent in females than males (Diflorio &amp; Jones, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Major depressive episodes typically precede hypomania in those ultimately diagnosed with bipolar II disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). If an individual initially had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the diagnosis would convert to bipolar II disorder upon the experience of a hypomanic episode. Similarly, a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder would convert to bipolar I if a manic episode were to occur.</para>

            <primary>Cyclothymic disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> is characterized by its chronicity and subthreshold hypomanic and depressive symptoms. This disorder requires at least a two-year period in which the individual has experienced numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode, and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not constitute a major depressive episode. The time length is shortened to at least 1 year of such patterning among children and adolescents. The individual cannot be symptom-free for more than two consecutive months and symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment. If an individual subsequently meets the criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar II disorder, or bipolar I disorder, the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is removed. The lifetime prevalence rate of cyclothymic disorder ranges from 0.4 to 2.5% (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

Examples of circumstances in which this diagnosis is appropriate include the presence of: (1) major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes of less than 4 days, (2) major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes with fewer than three symptoms, (3) hypomanic episodes and no history of major depressive episodes, and (4) symptoms of cyclothymic disorder for less than 2 years in adults or less than 1 year in children or adolescents.</para>

      <title>Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder</title>
      <para role="Para">The unspecified bipolar and related disorder diagnosis may be used in circumstances in which the individual displays symptoms of a bipolar or related disorder causing clinically significant distress or impairment but does not meet full criteria for any of the disorders discussed above. This diagnosis is often used when the clinician does not have enough information to make a more definitive diagnosis, such as after conducting a brief diagnostic screen under time constraints.</para>

      <title>Specifiers</title>
      <para role="Para">A variety of specifiers may be added to a diagnosis to provide further detail regarding the patient’s presentation. The “with anxious distress” specifier can be used to characterize patients with at least two symptoms of anxiety occurring during a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. Co-occurring anxiety is associated with greater illness severity among individuals with bipolar disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorders</primary>
         </indexterm>. An indication of a manic or hypomanic episode “with mixed features” refers to the presence of at least three co-occurring depressive symptoms during the episode; a depressive episode with mixed features indicates the presence of at least three concurrent hypomanic or manic symptoms. The “with rapid cycling” specifier refers to the presence of at least four episodes of hypomania, mania, or major depression occurring within the past year. Rapid cycling may be more common in women, is associated with greater illness severity, and has a high prevalence in individuals with bipolar II (Miola et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The “with melancholic features” specifier captures depressive episodes marked by a near-total loss of pleasurable feelings, while “with atypical features” refers to depressive episodes characterized by responsiveness to positive stimuli and increased appetite and sleep, among other symptoms. The “with mood-congruent psychotic features” or “with mood-incongruent psychotic features”<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>specifier</primary>
         </indexterm> can be applied when delusions or hallucinations are present within a manic or depressive episode (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>), and “with catatonia” can be specified when psychomotor immobility and lack of responsiveness to external stimuli are observed.</para>
      <para role="Para">The “with peripartum onset” specifier is applied when the mood episode occurs either during pregnancy or in the first 4 weeks after delivery. The postpartum period is particularly high risk among women with bipolar disorders; they are 23–37 times more likely to have a psychiatric admission in the 30 days following birth compared to non-childbearing periods (Munk-Olsen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Sharma et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Peripartum mood episodes with psychotic features occur in between 0.1 and 0.2% of deliveries and are more likely among women with histories of prior peripartum mood episodes or prior mood disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Perry et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The “with seasonal pattern” specifier can be applied if at least one type of episode tends to occur during a particular time of year for at least 2 years. The prototypical example of this specifier involves an onset of depression in the fall or winter that remits in the spring, although hypomania and mania may show seasonal patterns as well. The “with seasonal pattern” specifier is more common with bipolar II diagnoses compared to bipolar I (Fico et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The “in partial remission” specifier is utilized if symptoms of an episode still remain but no longer meet full criteria for the episode, or if there have been no significant symptoms for a period of less than 2 months. The “in full remission specifier” is employed when there have been no significant symptoms of an episode for at least 2 months. Mild, moderate, and severe specifiers can indicate the number and severity of symptoms as well as the degree of impairment for both major depressive and manic episodes, although the definitions of the severity specifiers vary slightly based on whether it is a manic or depressive episode.</para>
