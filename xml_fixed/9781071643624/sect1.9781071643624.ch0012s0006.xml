   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <sect2 id="ch0012s0006s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Comorbid Disorders</title>
      <para role="Para">When evaluating a client for a PTSD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>PTSD</primary>
         </indexterm> diagnosis, it is often the case that symptoms stemming from other disorders are also endorsed (Kessler et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Disorders that occur conjointly with PTSD are known as comorbid disorders. Comorbid disorders may start before the onset of PTSD symptoms, appear concurrently, or after PTSD symptoms are evident. Multiple studies have identified several disorders that are likely to appear comorbidly with PTSD, either as a primary or secondary disorder (Courtois &amp; Gold, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Perkonigg et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A landmark study by Breslau et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1991</phrase>
         </emphasis>) identified the rates of PTSD-comorbid disorders as agoraphobia (21.5%), drug abuse or dependence (21.5%), alcohol abuse or dependence (31.2%), major depression (36.6%), and any substance abuse or dependence (43.0%). Notably, being diagnosed with PTSD significantly increases the likelihood (82.8%) of being diagnosed with a second disorder (Brady et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Breslau et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1991</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Other studies have reported similar findings (Kessler et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Perkonigg et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Research also suggests that there<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>there</primary>
         </indexterm> is a significant positive correlation between PTSD and suicide. Sareen et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>) found that 20% of the study participants who were diagnosed with PTSD also endorsed suicidal ideation, and 6.5% reported that they had attempted suicide during the past year.</para>

      <title>Disorders That Mask PTSD Symptoms</title>
      <para role="Para">A disorder that shares similar symptomatology with PTSD (e. g., substance abuse, depression) could mask the presence of PTSD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>PTSD</primary>
         </indexterm> (Ellis &amp; Zaretsky, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Symptoms that are masked can result in an incorrect or partial diagnosis of PTSD and lead to the use of the wrong pharmacological or psychological treatment. When making a differential diagnosis, Wilson and Keane (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2004</phrase>
         </emphasis>) recommend considering (1) Premorbidity (i. e., review the client’s psychiatric history to determine the presence of a preexisting disorder) (2) Possible history of substance use before or after the traumatic event; (3) Specific changes in personality and behavior before or after the traumatic event; (4) Type of interaction between premorbid disorder, traumatic event, and PTSD—to better understand how the premorbid condition could influence the presentation of PTSD symptoms; and (5) Need for multiple diagnoses, when warranted, if necessary as PTSD can coexist with other disorders.</para>

      <title>Emerging Issues: Complex PTSD, Race-Based Trauma, and Moral Injury</title>
      <para role="Para">Complex PTSD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>PTSD</primary>
         </indexterm>is defined as “exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e. g., torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse)” (ICD-11, 2018). While the term is not formally acknowledged as a disorder in the DSM-5-TR, it is officially included in ICD-11 as a disorder. Because of the trauma’s unique characteristics, there is also a growing body of research evaluating psychotherapies for effectiveness in treating complex PTSD (Cloitre et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Courtois &amp; Gold, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Racial trauma, or race-based traumatic stress, is a unique form of stress where “negative race-based encounters can lead to extreme levels of stress and thus…the potential to produce traumatic reactions” (Carter et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>, p. 1). A study by Carter et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>) evaluated the relationship between racial trauma and PTSD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>PTSD</primary>
         </indexterm> and found a strong association, including symptoms of dissociation, changes in mood, sexual problems, and sleep disturbance.</para>
      <para role="Para">Moral injury describes psychological distress that is experienced by an individual and results from an event where one’s actions are not aligned with one’s morals. Shay (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>) defined moral injury as (a) “A betrayal of what’s right; (b) By someone who holds legitimate authority (e. g., commander in the military); (c) In a high stakes situation” (p. 183). Moral injury is not yet included in the DSM, possibly because its’ specific symptoms (i. e., the individual experiencing distress, the severity of distress) must be clarified. Moreover, some have questioned whether there is a substantial difference between a moral injury that is not captured by PTSD symptom criteria, other stress-related disorders, or even depression. However, it is possible that treatments that may work for PTSD (e. g., exposure therapy) or depression (e. g., psychodynamic therapy) may not be effective with moral injury (Litz et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). While PTSD without additional issues such as impulsivity or substance use does not significantly increase the risk for harm to self (i. e., suicide) or harm to others (i. e., homicidally), moral injury has been shown to increase the risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Shay,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>

      <title>Malingering</title>
      <para role="Para">The definition of malingering in the context of trauma-related disorders refers to “the intentional exaggeration<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>exaggeration</primary>
         </indexterm>or production of feigned physical or psychological symptoms of PTSD to obtain some external reward (i. e., avoiding criminal responsibility, compensation, attention” (Peace &amp; Masliuk,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Studies suggest that malingering or exaggeration of PTSD symptoms by veterans is more likely when disability compensation is involved (Freeman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Richardson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The possibility of malingering reinforces the importance of administering a structured interview, along with other relevant evidence-based assessments that measure exaggeration and can serve to corroborate the presence of symptoms, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2). Some consider malingering a maladaptive call for help. People who are feigning or exaggerating symptoms are likely feeling psychologically, financially, and socially distressed and would benefit from treatment to help manage their concerns and promote adaptive coping.</para>
