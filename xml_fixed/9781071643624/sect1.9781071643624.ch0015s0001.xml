      <title>What Are Eating Disorders?</title>
      <para role="Para">The term “eating disorders”<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>(EDs)</primary>
         </indexterm> broadly refers<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>refers</primary>
         </indexterm> to psychiatric disorders marked by maladaptive eating patterns and attitudes about eating, body shape, and body weight. The four ED diagnoses described in the <emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</emphasis> (<emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis>; American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and “other specified feeding or eating disorder” (OSFED).</para>
      <para role="Para">Approximately 82% of all EDs will onset by age 25 (Solmi et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Age-of-onset varies by ED, with age of onset for AN typically occurring in early-to-middle adolescence and age-of-onset for BN and BED occurring<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>occurring</primary>
         </indexterm> in the late teenage years to young adulthood. Prevalence rates for the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> EDs in adolescents are 5.7% in females and 1.2% in males (Smink et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Epidemiologic research conducted in Australia reported a 3-month point prevalence rate of 16.3% for any <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> ED, with most ED cases accounted for by BED and OSFED (Hay et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Research in the United States found a combined ED prevalence of 13.1% by age 20 (Stice et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Thus, in contrast to views of EDs as rare psychiatric disorders, they are relatively common in the general population. In the following sections<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> is characterized by restriction of energy intake that results in a significantly low body weight, given a person’s age, sex, and other developmental and physical health factors (Criterion A). Persons with AN may display an intense fear of weight gain <emphasis>or</emphasis> engage in persistent behaviors to avoid weight gain (Criterion B). People with AN may report a distorted perception of their weight and body shape, deny the seriousness of their low body weight, <emphasis>or</emphasis>base their self-evaluation on their weight or shape (Criterion C). It is important to note that a person with AN may not report concerns with body image or perceptual disturbance but may still meet criteria if there are persistent behaviors that are designed to prevent weight gain (e. g., excessive exercise, restricting food intake, etc.) and the person does not think that their<indexterm significance="normal">

The <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> does not provide a specific BMI cutoff for defining “significantly low body weight.” However, BMI cut-offs are included in the new <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> severity categories for AN that define severity based on BMI thresholds that range from mild to extreme.</para>
      <para role="Para">The <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> specifies two subtypes for AN: (1) restricting, in which no binge eating or purging behaviors occur, and (2) binge-eating/purging, in which the person engages in binge eating and/or purging behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior at least once per week (on average) for a period of 3 months.

      <para role="Para">An objective binge-eating episode refers to a discrete period (e. g., within 2 hours) in which an individual consumes an objectively large amount of food, in addition to experiencing a sense of loss-of-control (LOC)<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>. Although there are no caloric guidelines for what is considered objectively large, the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> indicates that the amount eaten needs to be “definitely larger” than what most other people would eat under similar circumstances. Interviewers may also want to consider the person’s body size and height, gender, and physical activity patterns when making judgments of whether<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>may be expressed by individuals in terms that include, but are not limited to, feeling as though binge-episodes were inevitable, like they could not stop eating once they started (e. g., like a ball rolling down a hill), or that they could not control what or how much was consumed. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and clients may have other lay terminology to describe their own subjective experience of LOC. For example, Forbush et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>) found that people who experience binge eating may characterize LOC<indexterm significance="normal">

Purging ICBs refer to the forced expelling of food from the body (through means such as self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics) or misuse of certain substances (e. g., insulin omission in persons with Type I diabetes or misuse of thyroid medicine to prevent weight gain or compensate for an eating episode).

            <primary>BED</primary>

In addition, an individual must meet criteria for three out of five associated features for BED, such as (1) eating much more rapidly than normal, (2) eating until uncomfortably full, (3) eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry, (4) eating alone due to embarrassment associated with how much one is eating, and (5) feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty after a binge. Finally, binge eating must cause marked distress.</para>

         also<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>also</primary>
         </indexterm> includes a category called “OSFED” to encompass ED presentations that cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet diagnostic criteria for AN, BN, or BED. OSFED is the most common ED diagnosis. OSFED does not necessarily imply that the person’s ED is less severe, but rather encompasses the large proportion of serious ED presentations that do not cleanly fit into the other diagnostic categories. A meta-analysis of mortality rates in the various ED diagnoses identified similar mortality rates in OSFED compared to full-threshold EDs (Solmi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> provides five specific examples of presentations that fall within the OSFED category. For example, <emphasis>atypical AN</emphasis>
         (atypAN)<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>individual’s</primary>
         </indexterm>weight is within or above a minimally healthy range. Given that the person with atypAN may have developed their illness at a higher baseline weight, this diagnosis is provided to intervene earlier in the illness course, rather than waiting until the person reaches a significantly low body weight. Purging disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Purging disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> is an OSFED in which an individual engages in recurrent purging behavior to influence their weight or shape in the absence of objective binge-eating episodes. Night eating syndrome<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Night eating syndrome</primary>
         </indexterm> is an OSFED characterized by recurrent consumption of food after waking up from sleep or the excessive consumption of food following an evening meal. Notably, the individual has full awareness and recollection of food consumption, which differentiates it from parasomnias such as sleep-related eating disorders. Other OSFEDs include BN and BED of lower frequency or duration. Lastly, in addition to the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> examples of OSFEDs, compensatory eating disorder is a newly proposed OSFED<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>OSFED</primary>

      <title>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder</title>

            <primary>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</primary>
         </indexterm> is designated in the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> as a feeding disorder, not an ED, we included ARFID in this chapter because cases of ARFID are often seen in ED treatment settings. ARFID, which can occur within individuals of all ages, is characterized by avoidant or restrictive eating behavior resulting in substantial weight loss or nutritional deficiency or marked psychosocial impairment. An important indicator of ARFID is that the restrictive eating behaviors are not driven by weight or body image concerns. Three common features (though not exhaustive) that can contribute to disturbances in eating among individuals with ARFID include: (1) an apparent<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>apparent</primary>
         </indexterm>lack of interest in eating; (2) an avoidance based on the sensory characteristics (e. g., smells, tastes, textures, temperatures, and appearances) of food; and (3) a concern about the aversive consequences of eating, such as choking or contracting<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>contracting</primary>
         </indexterm>an illness or disease from food.</para>
      <para role="Para">Due to the consequences of nutritional deficiency in both AN and ARFID, there are considerable similarities in how these two disorders present clinically (Kambanis &amp; Thomas,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is important to note, however, that body-image disturbances and persistent behaviors to prevent weight gain are not a component of the ARFID diagnosis in the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR.</emphasis> For this reason, it can be particularly difficult to differentiate cases of ARFID from cases of AN in which symptoms of fat phobia are absent. To make a definitive diagnosis of ARFID, the clinician must rule out AN and BN, and ARFID symptoms should not be attributable to cultural practices, a lack of food resources, or a medical condition that<indexterm significance="normal">
