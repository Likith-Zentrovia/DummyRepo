      <para role="Para">I: I was doing pretty well for myself. I had a job, an apartment, and a car and in the middle of everything I left to go to New York City. I saw a television show about Wall Street and I thought it was about me. I was getting messages from commercials, movies, from other people. When I interacted with people I got hidden messages from them. I believed that important financial people wanted me to go to New York City and that I would become rich if I went there.</para>
