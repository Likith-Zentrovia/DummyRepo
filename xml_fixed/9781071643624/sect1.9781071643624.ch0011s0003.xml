            <phrase>1989</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is the gold standard instrument for assessing the presence and severity of OCD symptoms in adults. The Y-BOCS is a semi-structured, clinician-administered interview that contains two parts. The Symptom Checklist assesses the presence of a wide range of obsessions and compulsions, while the Severity Scale consists of 10 questions assessing the severity of obsessions and compulsions, each of which the clinician rates on a scale of 1–4 depending on the patient’s responses. If a patient is suspected to be under- or overreporting symptoms, the clinician uses clinical judgment to rate the item. The Children’s Y-BOCS (CY-BOCS; Scahill et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1997</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is the analogous measure for children ages 6–17 years. It is recommended that both the child and their caregiver(s) are interviewed together, as this allows clinicians to obtain the most accurate clinical picture, although clinician judgment should dictate this<indexterm significance="normal">

            <phrase>2006</phrase>

Based on the patient’s questionnaire responses and the clinician’s observations while reviewing these with the patient, the clinician rates dimensional symptom severity, global symptom severity, and global impairment. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Global Obsessive Compulsive Scale (GOCS) is a single-item, clinician-rated measure of OCD symptom severity.</para>

      <title>Self-Reported Measures for Adults</title>
      <para role="Para">Self-reported measures of OCD for adults have been used as screening tools, as well as tools to gather additional information that may not be available via clinician-rated measures. These include the Y-BOCS-Self-Report (Storch et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <title>Child- and Parent-Reported Measures</title>
      <para role="Para">For children and adolescents under the age of 18 years, the following child-report and parent-report measures are appropriate for assessing OCD symptom severity. The CY-BOCS-Child-Report and -Parent-Report (Storch et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>) are each 10-item questionnaires derived directly from the CY-BOCS. The OCI-Child Version (OCI-CV; Foa et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is a child-reported version of the OCI, which assesses symptom severity across six domains including hoarding. In light of literature suggesting that hoarding is separate from OCD, researchers developed the OCI-CV-Revised (Abramovitch et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022a</phrase>
         </emphasis>), which removed the three hoarding items from the OCI-CV. The Children’s FOCI (Storch et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is the child-report version of the FOCI, which, like the FOCI, boasts a brief administration time of 5–10 min. The Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale (Piacentini et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>

      <title>Measures of OCD-Related Factors</title>

Although it was developed for a range of disorders including psychosis, it is widely used to assess insight in patients with OCD. Family accommodation, which refers to family behaviors that are intended to reduce patient’s OCD-related distress, but fuel OCD symptoms in the long term (e. g., taking on patients’ responsibilities so they can avoid OCD triggers), is also highly relevant to the assessment and treatment of OCD<indexterm significance="normal">
