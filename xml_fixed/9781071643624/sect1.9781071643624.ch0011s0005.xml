      <title>Gender</title>
      <para role="Para">The prevalence of OCD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>OCD</primary>
         </indexterm> is similar for both females and males; however, there are some gender differences in the onset of symptoms, comorbid diagnoses, and subtype or presentation of OCD symptoms. For instance, males have a greater likelihood of symptom onset in childhood perhaps linked to co-occurrence of Tourette or autism, while OCD is more common for females in adolescence and adulthood (Mathes et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, males are more likely to present with comorbid tic disorders and females are more likely to present with comorbid excoriation disorder or eating disorders (Mathis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, females are more likely to present with contamination subtype, whereas males are more likely to present with sexual and symmetry-related obsessions. There are inconclusive findings for gender differences with harm-related obsessions, as many studies report mixed results. There are no reported gender differences in treatment outcomes (for reviews, see Mathis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Mathes et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Considering these findings, it is important that clinicians make note of common presenting subtypes for each gender when assessing and evaluating individuals for OCD.</para>

      <title>Age</title>
      <para role="Para">Despite OCD onset being most common in adolescence (mean age of onset = 16.9 years; Brakoulias et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>), intrusive thoughts and compulsions can appear during early childhood between ages 5 and 7 (Garcia et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although older adults may present with OCD symptoms, the onset of their symptoms is likely to have started in childhood/young adulthood and progressed as they aged (Grenier et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0011s0005s03" role="Heading">
      <title>Race and Ethnicity</title>
      <para role="Para">Ethnically/racially minoritized groups are often unrepresented and understudied in OCD research, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis and cultural insensitivity in clinical practice. According to Williams et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>), clinicians who are unfamiliar with different cultural backgrounds may inadvertently convey through their words or actions disrespect, insensitivity, or discrimination. For instance, clinicians may hold stereotypes about how people of color cope and what types of presenting<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>presenting</primary>
         </indexterm> concerns they report, resulting in misdiagnosis or avoidance of discussion of OCD symptoms when clinically indicated (Williams et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, African Americans with OCD are more likely to be misdiagnosed with other disorders, such as psychosis, as a result of culturally specific explanations for their symptomology. Additionally, Latinos continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials for OCD, which may be due to a reluctance to participate in psychological treatment and/or research. Latinos may be hesitant to seek help for their OCD symptoms due to cultural stigma, attribution of symptoms to somatic reasons, socioeconomic barriers, or fears that clinicians may misunderstand their concerns due to limited education on cultural norms/differences (Wetterneck et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Given that minoritized populations are less likely to seek treatment than their White counterparts, it is important that mental health providers disseminate psychoeducation in these communities to decrease stigma and provide an accurate description of what symptoms are consistent with an OCD diagnosis. Mental health providers can adapt their recruitment efforts to ensure minoritized communities are able to receive accurate diagnostic assessment and treatment, such as having fliers for psychological services in various languages, providing affordable assessment and treatment options (i. e., financial compensation with clinical trials, sliding scale option), and having flexible appointment slots that accommodate families’ work schedules (Wetterneck et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Multiple marginalized identities (i. e., race, gender, sexuality) can also lead to greater OCD symptom severity, as individuals may experience greater symptoms of depression and lower quality of life during treatment and after discharge compared to their more privileged counterparts (Wadsworth et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Throughout the diagnostic process, it is important for clinicians to be mindful of patients’ ethnic/racial and intersecting identities.</para>

      <title>Religion and Spirituality</title>
      <para role="Para">Religious and spiritual backgrounds can shape the presentation of certain domains of OCD symptoms<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>symptoms</primary>
         </indexterm>. For individuals who experience obsessions or compulsions related to their religious or spiritual beliefs, intrusive thoughts can be associated with specific customs of their religion, such as scripture or beliefs regarding the afterlife. For example, an individual who identifies as Muslim and is from an Islam-based faith may engage in contamination-related compulsions in addition to washing rituals during prayer that other Muslims follow. When assessing children experiencing OCD related to religious thoughts, it can be especially helpful to gather information from their parents to distinguish normative practices within their faith community from obsessions and compulsions. For example, a child from a Christian faith may have the urge to compulsively pray outside of what is typical for the family or what is suggested at church.</para>
      <para role="Para">As an individual’s religion or faith can be an influential part of their identity, they may wish to enlist support from religious leaders or healers within their community. There can be a risk for mental health providers to attempt to control or suppress an individual’s religious or spiritual beliefs if they perceive that the religion is at the root of the individual’s intrusive thoughts or is exacerbating OCD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>OCD</primary>
         </indexterm> symptoms (Williams et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is important that clinicians assess and treat OCD while being mindful and respectful of the confines of the individual’s religious beliefs/traditions. When necessary, it can be helpful for clinicians to defer to the client’s religious leaders or healers to identify normative practices for the religion. Although it is not required for clinicians to be experts in specific religions for successful OCD treatment, increasing knowledge on basic customs and traditions within the religion can increase rapport and assist with differentiating normative cultural/religious practices from compulsions (Williams et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
