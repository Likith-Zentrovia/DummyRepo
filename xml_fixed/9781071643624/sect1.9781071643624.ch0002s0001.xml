   <title>The Impact of the Interview Setting</title>
   <para role="Para">Perhaps the first critical factor that influences the nature of the interview is the setting in which the interview takes place. There are a variety of settings in which interviews may occur and the type of setting often determines how the client is approached. Specifically, the setting will help determine the depth<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>depth</primary>
      </indexterm> and length of the interview, the domains of functioning that are assessed, the types of questions that should be asked, and the degree of cooperation that can be expected. For example, the level of cooperation that can be expected from a jailed youth offender who is being forced to participate in court-ordered psychotherapy will be substantially different than that from an adult or older adult who is burdened with responsibilities of caring for a frail family member and who is eagerly and voluntarily seeking psychotherapy at a community mental health clinic. As such, each interview will require a different approach because of the circumstances of how each client comes to be interviewed and the expectations established for client behavior. To address the issues of the setting on the interviewing process, we discuss emergency and crisis settings, outpatient mental health settings, medical settings, and jail, prison, and courthouse settings.</para>

      <title>Emergency and Crisis Settings</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Emergency and crisis settings<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Emergency and crisis settings</primary>
         </indexterm> are diverse and include general hospital emergency rooms, inpatient psychiatric hospitals, and crisis centers. Clients who may be encountered in these settings include individuals with acute medical problems that are compounded by psychiatric factors (including those in acute pain), people who are brought for psychiatric evaluation by law enforcement or emergency medical personnel, individuals involved in voluntary or involuntary psychiatric commitment proceedings, and people who are experiencing an acute, often volatile crisis situation. Individuals requiring emergency care may exhibit psychotic disturbances, including active <emphasis>hallucinations</emphasis> (false sensory experiences, such as hearing voices when none is objectively present), <emphasis>delusions</emphasis> (false beliefs, not supported by one’s culture, such as paranoid ideation), and <emphasis>disorganized thinking and speech</emphasis>(incoherent, confused, rambling, or tangential thinking and speech, along with decreased problem-solving ability); drug and alcohol problems, including acute intoxication and disorientation; organic brain syndromes, such as a traumatic brain injury, delirium, or other types of neurological disorders; depressive disorders (e. g., severe depression with psychotic features and/or active suicidal thoughts); and personality disorders, especially those characterized by volatile and impulsive behaviors (e. g., borderline personality disorder).</para>
      <para role="Para">Because the interview occurs under emergency conditions, clinicians should be prepared to alter the style and format of the traditional interview. Some clients in emergency settings are frightened by their perceptions and feelings, as well as by the surroundings in which they find themselves, and they may exhibit extremes in emotions. They may be too agitated, frightened, or paranoid to provide detailed histories. Thus, the goal in such settings is to gain enough information to make a tentative diagnosis and offer emergency treatment planning, including whether to hospitalize the person or not. One primary focus should be a thorough assessment of dangerousness, including suicidal<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>suicidal</primary>
         </indexterm> and homicidal ideation or plans. Some emergency departments in the USA have enacted a universal screening approach to suicidality, which has resulted in greater screenings and greater detection of those at risk for suicide (Betz et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Nevertheless, challenges remain even in these settings, including barriers to lethal-means assessment (Betz et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and some worrisome disparities in suicide screening and interventions for older adults (Arias et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Betz et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">In emergency settings, a careful examination of the client’s current mental status is more important than a detailed social history or formal psychological testing. It is helpful to try and pinpoint how and why the client is in the current state of crisis and what the immediate precipitating<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>precipitating</primary>
         </indexterm> events were (Dattilio et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>), although the full story may not always be easy to discern. Keep in mind that a calm and understanding attitude on the part of the clinician can increase the client’s comfort level enough to allow the interviewer to obtain a reasonable sense of the nature of the problem. Collateral interviews with others who know the client reasonably well (e. g., friends and/or family members) are usually important in emergency settings, especially if the client is unwilling or unable to participate in the interview.</para>

      <title>Outpatient Mental Health Settings</title>
      <para role="Para">Compared to clients seen in emergency settings, clients served by outpatient community mental health centers and private outpatient practices will have a more varied range of psychopathology. While psychotic disturbances and suicidal ideation may be encountered within this setting, typically clients are more<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>more</primary>
         </indexterm> stable and not in severe enough crisis to warrant hospitalization. Therefore, the nature of the interview will be considerably different from that in emergency and crisis settings.</para>
      <para role="Para">The objective of the interview in the traditional outpatient setting is to learn as much about the client’s current psychological and emotional functioning as possible, including the client’s reasons for seeking psychotherapy (often called the presenting problem), and to fully explore the client’s personal history (often called the social history) to put the client’s current problems in a proper context<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>context</primary>
         </indexterm>. The interview is typically guided by the problems and fortitude of the client, and because there is generally little or no mystery for the client as to the purpose of the interview, there is generally less resistance during the interview. Thus, the interviewer will typically have more time and less trouble in conducting a comprehensive interview, which typically occurs during a 60–90 min session. A thorough understanding of the client’s current and past difficulties and the contexts in which the struggles occur is necessary for the clinician to develop an initial conceptualization of the problem and to develop an appropriate initial treatment plan.</para>
      <para role="Para">Compared to the pressure of emergency settings, interviewers in outpatient settings are usually afforded the luxury of time to establish rapport with the client and lay the groundwork for a productive therapeutic relationship. In outpatient settings, clients may be inquisitive about the nature of their problems or disorders (sometimes requesting a formal diagnosis), the causes of their problems or disorders, and the pragmatics of treatment (e. g., fees, length of treatment, and the theoretical orientation or general approach of the clinician). These questions should be addressed candidly and sensitively to promote transparency and to foster trust in the relationship (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Of course, there is no crystal ball to determine precisely how long treatment will last for a particular client, but it is often helpful to establish a general time frame with the client and to secure an initial agreement<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>agreement</primary>
         </indexterm> to treatment with a plan to review progress in a short period of time: “How would you feel about making an initial commitment to weekly psychotherapy for the next 8 weeks? At the end of that time (if not sooner), let’s evaluate how we are doing together and decide how we should proceed, to determine if we need to contract for another series of sessions.” Being transparent and forthright, to the extent possible, in answering questions about diagnosis and treatment will help the client develop an informed perspective on his or her treatment, specifically, what can and cannot be done, and what the long-term prognosis entails, at least in general. Even if the client does not request such information, it may be helpful for the clinician to address these types of issues with the client at the end of the initial interview.</para>

      <title>Medical Settings</title>
      <para role="Para">
         Medical settings<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Medical settings</primary>
         </indexterm>(e. g., medical school hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, integrated care settings) present unique challenges for clinical work. Often, medical patients have not made the request to consult with a mental health professional, but rather the referral is the decision of the treating medical provider. The reason for the referral may or may not have been explained fully to the patient, and therefore, the patient may be initially hesitant or reluctant to communicate with the clinician and, in some cases, may even refuse to be interviewed (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Individuals in this setting frequently have various medical illnesses and therefore have defined their “problem” as solely a medical one. As such, they may not understand why a mental health professional has been called to see them.</para>
      <para role="Para">It behooves the mental health clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>clinician</primary>
         </indexterm> in medical settings to be prepared for patients who have varying levels of knowledge about the referral process, including some patients with very limited information about the referral. As such, at the beginning of the interview, the clinician should introduce him or herself, explain the purpose of the consultation, and state who requested it. In medical settings, the clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>clinician</primary>
         </indexterm> is likely to garner cooperation with the medical patient when the clinician presents him or herself as an information gatherer and acknowledges the client’s medical issues without immediately suggesting that there is a psychological piece to the disturbance, even if one is suspected. If the clinician is fortunate enough to work within an interdisciplinary team within an integrated care setting, the interview can be framed as “comprehensive care” which may decrease some of the stigma associated with mental health treatment.</para>
      <para role="Para">In these settings, clinicians also should be prepared to adjust the format and length of the interview according to the needs of the medical patient. Depending upon the medical conditions experienced by the patient<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>patient</primary>
         </indexterm>, he or she may be in considerable discomfort, which impacts one’s ability to engage in a dialogue and answer questions. Some medical patients may need a period of cultivation (e. g., having a few informal visits to get to know the patient) before they are willing to delve into emotional concerns<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>concerns</primary>
         </indexterm> or psychological topics, requiring the clinician to be flexible on the number of visits needed to complete the interviewing task. Clinicians in medical settings also need to be mindful of the other professionals working within the facility and the schedules to which these other professionals must adhere. Ample flexibility and coordination with the other care providers help to ensure the interview sessions and treatment sessions have as few interruptions as possible.</para>
      <para role="Para">If the clinician is a consultant in a medical setting, it is particularly important to avoid being manipulated into siding with the client against the healthcare provider. It is critical to maintain the stance of an investigator with no specific position. Consultant clinicians must remember they are invited by the treating physician to render their expert advice on a particular problem. A major difficulty<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>difficulty</primary>
         </indexterm> can arise if clinicians in this setting voice negative statements and judgments about other aspects of the patient’s care. This type of behavior will most certainly have a negative impact on the doctor–patient relationship and the doctor–clinician relationship to work in the best interest of the medical patient.</para>

      <title>Jail, Prison, Corrections, and Courthouse Settings</title>
      <para role="Para">There are certain aspects of correctional facilities which present unique challenges to the clinical interviewer including population factors, limits to confidentiality<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>confidentiality</primary>
         </indexterm>, and environmental factors. Depending upon the reason for referral, these settings can have a distinctly adversarial tone<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>tone</primary>
         </indexterm>. Clients may range from being very resistant and defiant of the entire process to being overly attentive and concerned. Some clients, in fact, may honestly want psychological assistance. A client’s motivation to be truthful, forthright, and forthcoming with information will also depend upon the perceived referral question and the circumstances of the interview (Faust, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). People in jail and prison settings have higher rates of mental disorders compared to the general population. Indeed, a recent survey indicated that 43% of state prisoners and 23% of federal prisoners had a history of a mental health problem (Maruschak et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). As such, mental health screens and assessments are particularly<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>particularly</primary>
         </indexterm> important in these settings. Without adequate assessment for potential mental disorders and subsequent treatment, inmates may be at risk of harming themselves or other inmates, may become targets for violence, or may become disruptive to prison operations (Lee, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">In these settings, privacy is likely to be limited when conducting interviews as other people (e. g., fellow inmates, guards, attorneys) may be within listening proximity to the interview. Additionally, because many of these evaluations are court mandated,confidentiality<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>confidentiality</primary>
         </indexterm> of records does not apply (Faust, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In these cases, clinicians should be clear and honest with the client about these limits and the role of the clinician. The clinician may also be restricted by time in this setting. In an emergency hearing, for example, the clinician may have limited time to interview the client and make recommendations. Prisons tend to have rigid schedules, and mental health clinicians often have little to no control over the schedule or time allotted for the interview. At other times, the clinician will need to coordinate his or her schedule with others at the jail or prison, limiting flexibility as compared to some other settings. Safety is another important concern in these settings. It is important for clinicians to be aware of their surroundings and to avoid exposure to vulnerable positions as much as possible (Lee, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Although most inmates do not become aggressive or violent toward clinicians, certain inmates may need to be left in restraints throughout the interview, and often a prison guard will remain present or just outside the door throughout the interview process (Lee, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">During interviews in this setting, the clinician may want to look for inconsistencies in the client’s behavior and self-report because there may be perceived benefits to the client to either minimize reports of psychopathology or conversely to exaggerate mental health concerns. When possible, interviewing significant people in the client’s life (e. g., spouses, parents, children) may also be informative (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For example, referrals concerning adult guardianship often require the court-appointed clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>clinician</primary>
         </indexterm>to interview both parties vying for guardianship as well as other people involved in the adult’s life (e. g., guardian ad litem, the adult protective agency worker, the adult’s children, other kin). These additional interviews can help to verify information, uncover inconsistencies, and ultimately help the clinician determine the most optimal course of action.</para>
      <para role="Para">It is especially important for clinicians to evaluate their personal biases and reduce judgment which may occur when working with individuals who are incarcerated. Clinicians may naturally have more negative views about inmates than the general population, especially those inmates who have committed especially heinous crimes such as child sexual abuse or murder. Negative reactions to the interviewee may cause the clinician to lose objectivity; this may lead to difficulty exploring all relevant<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>relevant</primary>
         </indexterm> areas or missing diagnoses. Inmates are also often expecting judgment and therefore may be more sensitive to changes in the clinician’s demeanor which may suggest negative feelings toward the inmate. This will damage rapport and make diagnostic interviewing more difficult and less effective (Lee, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clinicians should be careful to assess their biases and maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, no matter what the population.</para>
