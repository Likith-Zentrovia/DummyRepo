   <title>Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Individuals who use substances, like everyone, have intersectional identities and experiences, which often influence disparities in SUD assessment and treatment options. In this section, we focus on a few of the factors impacting these disparities including gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and age.</para>

         </indexterm> men and women for consistency herein, and because most previous studies rely on self-report of gender rather than biological sex. Research suggests that women use substances at a higher rate than men in early adolescence, but that men have higher rates of substance use in middle adolescence-early adulthood (Chen &amp; Jacobson, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and greater<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>rates of lifetime exposure to all categories of substances (Lev-Ran et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, the gender gap in adult men and women with SUD is narrowing, and reports suggest that the difference in SUD prevalence by gender may be due to differences in access to substances between men and women. Further, while women remain less likely to develop SUD, women develop an SUD and experience more severe consequences of substance use over shorter periods of time (Mc Hugh et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Gender differences<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>differences</primary>
         </indexterm> have also been documented in SUD treatment. Women are less likely to enter SUD treatment than men, yet rates of women in SUD treatment are increasing (NIDA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention for outpatient, residential, or medication-assisted therapy (Hochheimer &amp; Unick, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Stahler et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, it is important to assess specific factors that disproportionately affect women and predict treatment response such as co-occurring MDD and a history of trauma (Boughner &amp; Frewen, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>), to help identify women at high risk for treatment dropout<indexterm significance="normal">

      <title>Race and Ethnicity</title>
      <para role="Para">The prevalence<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>prevalence</primary>
         </indexterm> of substance use and SUD varies across racial and ethnic groups. A higher proportion of Whites than any other group endorse past month alcohol use, whereas American Indians/Alaska Natives and multiracial people have the highest rates of illicit drug use and alcohol/drug use disorders (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Racial and ethnic disparities affect the need for, access to, and use of treatment, and treatment completion rates. For example, Asian Americans with past-year SUDs have a higher<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>higher</primary>
         </indexterm> likelihood of unmet need for treatment compared to Whites (Mulvaney-Day et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). There are also differences in the types of SUD treatment received across racial and ethnic groups; for example, White adults were more likely to receive treatment at a private doctor’s office compared to their Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian counterparts (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Whites<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Whites</primary>
         </indexterm>also demonstrate lower rates of early treatment termination compared to Black/African American and Hispanic adults, even when controlling for sociodemographic variables including SES (Mennis &amp; Stahler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Black/African American adults have been shown to initiate treatment later than other racial/ethnic groups (Montgomery et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and may be less likely to complete treatment (Mennis &amp; Stahler, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Evidence suggests that minority stress and discrimination contribute to inequities (Matsuzaka &amp; Knapp, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>), so integrating assessments of minority stress and discrimination<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>discrimination</primary>
         </indexterm>may help identify risk factors for poor treatment outcomes.</para>

         </indexterm> has been found to influence risk for substance use, the development of SUDs, and post-treatment outcomes. Research suggests that low childhood SES predicts later drug use (Fothergill et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This may be due in part to lower engagement in substance-free pleasurable activities and greater engagement in activities paired with substance use among children with low SES (Lewis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Multiple indicators of SES predict substance use and related problems among<indexterm significance="normal">

         adults<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>adults</primary>
         </indexterm>, including education and income (Elliott &amp; Lowman, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>), neighborhood disadvantage (Boardman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <phrase>2018</phrase>

            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). One factor known to contribute to higher risk of substance use and SUDs among low-SES individuals is psychological distress (Nagelhout et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These data highlight the importance of assessing psychological distress and related mental health symptoms in the context of substance use<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>assessment, especially when working in low-SES communities.</para>

         Research<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Research</primary>
         </indexterm> has consistently demonstrated that early initiation of substance use (generally defined as prior to age 15) is related to a host of problems in adulthood, including a rapid escalation of other substance use and substance-related problems (Zhang et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Underlying personality constructs may partly account for these associations, supported by the high association between attention-deficit hyperactive disorder, conduct disorder, and early age of onset of substance use (Brinkman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Assessing the age of onset of substance use may thus provide some insight into problem severity and potential issues related to personality (e. g., impulsivity) and psychopathology, which may influence the likelihood of success after treatment.</para>
      <para role="Para">Rates of substance use and substance use disorders have been steadily increasing in older adults (&gt;age 50) (Schepis &amp; Mc Cabe,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Screening and diagnosis is often missed among older adults, often due to under-reporting, differences in symptom presentation, and the resemblance between SUD symptoms and confounding age-related conditions (e. g., cognitive impairment, depression, sleep problems) (Lehmann &amp; Fingerhood,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The current generation of older adults has historically reported higher rates<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>rates</primary>
         </indexterm> of lifetime substance use compared to prior generations, and therefore, it is expected that rates of SUD will continue to grow (Yarnell et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). An increase in the assessment of substance use among older adults is needed in primary care or other non-substance use treatment settings, along with clinician awareness that presenting physical and mental health symptoms may be due to substance use instead of normative<indexterm significance="normal">
