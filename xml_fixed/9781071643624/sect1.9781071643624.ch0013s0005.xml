   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">Regardless of whether the criteria for a DD are met, comorbidity is typical when severe dissociative symptoms are present. Therefore, it is critical to understand what other diagnoses have a high frequency of dissociative symptoms, as well as how comorbidity can obscure the presence of a DD. For example, dissociation that did not rise to the level of a DD diagnosis is common in BPD, DPTSD, conversion disorders, complex PTSD, depressive symptoms, OCD, substance use disorders, and schizophrenia (e. g., Lyssenko et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <title>Differential Diagnosis</title>
      <para role="Para">Making the diagnosis<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>diagnosis</primary>
         </indexterm> of a DD can be challenging for many reasons (Brand, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). First, clients rarely volunteer information about their dissociative symptoms or trauma histories, so clinicians must inquire about both. Clients with DDs are typically aware that their symptoms sound “crazy”—creating shame, confusion, and/or fear that can reduce willingness to discuss them. It is common for them to report they are “losing their minds.” Second, many severely dissociative clients attempt to hide their poor memory, so clinicians need to directly ask about amnesia, as well as be attentive to brief moments of not recalling earlier aspects of the interview. For example, if a person shows a shift in affect, the assessor can ask them what was being discussed just before the change, especially if the mood shift(s) is accompanied by behavioral signs that may indicate dissociation. Third, most clinicians have received minimal training, if any, about trauma and dissociation, so they<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>they</primary>
         </indexterm> do not know what to ask or watch for, nor how to distinguish dissociative symptoms from similar seeming symptoms (Brand, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Fourth, severely dissociative clients may be unable to accurately report some of their symptoms and elements of their life history due to amnestic gaps for childhood, adolescence, and/or adulthood. Furthermore, their ability to recall their daily activities and history can vary, sometimes even within a single assessment session, according to how dissociative they are in the moment. These individuals’ variable memory and amnestic gaps can be confounding for clinicians who are not familiar with DDs, who may mistake this for dementia, substance abuse, or malingering. These alternative hypotheses must also be considered. Assessors may need longer assessment periods before making a differential diagnosis. Fifth,dissociative<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>dissociative</primary>
         </indexterm> symptoms can easily be mistaken for symptoms of other disorders. For example, hearing voices is often mistaken for a psychotic process such as occurs in schizophrenia, although research indicates that traumatized nonpsychotic people can experience auditory hallucinations (Brand &amp; Loewenstein, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Longden et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The shifts from flat to depressed or irritable affect, or to agitation, are often mistaken for bipolar or borderline personality disorder. While these disorders can co-occur with DDs, they are not synonymous and they can be due to an undetected DD. Sixth, skepticism about the existence and/or validity of DDs can contribute to misdiagnosis; this is an important topic worth further discussion.</para>

         </indexterm> and lack<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>lack</primary>
         </indexterm>of training about dissociation often co-exist. A survey of psychologists found that only 5% felt knowledgeable about DID, and 73% reported having received little or no training about DID (Mendez et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Skepticism<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Skepticism</primary>
         </indexterm> and lack of knowledge about the disorder were correlated, suggesting that more training about dissociation would be useful. Only 60.4% of US clinicians could correctly diagnose DID when presented with a vignette clearly depicting the condition (Perniciaro, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The most frequent misdiagnoses were PTSD (14.3%), schizophrenia (9.9%), and major depression (6.6%). Accurate diagnoses were most often made by clinicians who had treated a DID patient and who accepted the validity of DID. Of concern, clinicians were confident in their diagnoses, regardless of their accuracy. Studies documenting a lack of training<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>training</primary>
         </indexterm> about dissociation and linking this knowledge gap with misdiagnosis of DDs have been conducted in the United States, Northern Ireland, and Australia, indicating a widespread lack of training about DDs (Dorahy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Perniciaro, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">The complexity of these individuals can obscure a DD (Brand,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). DD clients typically have multiple comorbid psychological and medical disorders (International Society for the Study of Dissociation et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Along with a mixture of dissociative symptoms, individuals with complex DDs typically experience additional difficulties including PTSD, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, somatoform symptoms, self-destructive and suicidal behavior, and personality disorder traits (e. g., Dell,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2002</phrase>
         </emphasis>). They report higher levels of first rank symptoms than do patients with schizophrenia, with the exception of audible<indexterm significance="normal">

            <phrase>1990</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The individual may be partially conscious of some aspects of dissociation (e. g., hearing voices, thought insertion/withdrawal, “made” actions/impulses) as well as completely unaware of what they do in some states (e. g., time loss) (Dell,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clinicians need to be knowledgeable and up-to-date about research that provides empirically based guidance for interpreting traumatized individuals’ performance on psychological tests and interviews, particularly in forensic and disability assessments, where there may be motivation to exaggerate symptoms. Distinguishing exaggerated from factitious, malingered, and genuine DDs is further complicated because<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>because</primary>
         </indexterm> individuals may fully fabricate their symptoms, or they may have a genuine DD yet exaggerate some of their symptoms (Brand, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Research has shown that many validity scales that were developed to detect possible exaggeration or malingering included symptoms that are common among trauma survivors; when these individuals honestly report the wide range of symptoms they experience, their endorsement of items which were thought to be rare may elevate their scores such that they are misclassified as feigning (reviewed in Brand, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

Space constraints limit this discussion to noting that individuals with genuine DDs are at risk for being misdiagnosed, and/or misclassified as feigning, by many validity tests and interviews if the assessor is not aware of research with DDs [see Brand (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
