   <title>Description of the Disorder</title>
   <para role="Para">Over the past 100 years, there has been a growing recognition of schizophrenia as a syndrome with a distinct constellation of symptoms, a variable course, and other associated features. Although there is general consensus about some aspects of this disorder, there is still a great deal to learn regarding etiology, pathophysiology, and successful treatments. In this section, we will provide a brief background of what is currently known about the prevalence, course, etiology, characteristic symptoms<indexterm significance="normal">

         Schizophrenia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Schizophrenia</primary>
         </indexterm> is among the top ten leading causes of disability worldwide (World Health Organization, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is estimated to affect 1% of the population, although there is significant variability in incidence across studies. There is a slightly higher incidence among males than females with males also tending to have an earlier age of onset and a generally less favorable course. The typical age of onset is during adolescence or early adulthood. Genetic factors play a strong role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and a number of different genes are implicated in risk for the disorder (Zamanpoor, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, no single genetic factor has consistently been identified, suggesting that multiple genes may combine or interact to give rise to this complex disorder. In addition, several environmental factors are associated with slight<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>slight</primary>
         </indexterm> but reliable increases in risk for schizophrenia. These include prenatal infection, obstetric and perinatal complications, winter/spring season of birth (Davies et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">Historically,schizophrenia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>schizophrenia</primary>
         </indexterm>was considered to be a progressive disorder with a poor and deteriorating course. However, several studies of long-term outcome in schizophrenia indicate there are several course types and outcomes. Approximately a third experience a stable or fluctuating course, about a third experience deterioration, and the remaining third experience lasting improvements. Although symptoms may be quite variable over time, the cognitive and functional deficits associated with schizophrenia frequently both predate the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist even during periods<indexterm significance="normal">

Auditory hallucinations generally occur when the individual hears a voice or voices that are not their own.

            <primary>Delusions</primary>
         </indexterm> are considered to be bizarre if they are clearly implausible and disconnected from typical life experiences or the cultural context of the individual’s experience, for example, the belief that one’s brain has been replaced with another person’s brain would be considered bizarre (since it is not possible at all to occur). In contrast, a non-bizarre delusion represents a false belief that could actually occur, for example, the belief that the government is spying on a person.</para>
