   <title>Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Multiple dimensions of diversity impact the assessment of depressive disorders, including race and ethnicity, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and age. A thorough review of diagnostic considerations for each diverse group is beyond the scope of this chapter; rather, the focus is on general considerations and strategies. Moreover, there are significant individual differences within groups that require a flexible, individualized approach to diagnostic interviewing. The individual’s background likely impacts the assessment process from the first encounter, as the clinician strives to build trust, rapport, and socialize the individual to the assessment process. As the assessment progresses, the client’s background may influence how symptoms are reported, observed, and conceptualized, for which the clinician needs to consider the validity of standardized assessment tools being used and additional cultural factors to assess. Finally, depressive symptoms occur in the context of other biopsychosocial considerations, which inform the clinician’s case conceptualization and treatment planning.</para>

      <title>Rapport Building and Education About the Assessment Process</title>
      <para role="Para">The next section primarily focuses on rapport building in the clinical interviewing and assessment process relating to older adult and minoritized populations. Specifically, older adults (60+ years) enter mental health assessments with a wide range of perceptions about themselves, their environments, the presenting problems, and their providers and healthcare settings. Compared to younger adults, older adults face unique barriers to mental health services, such as lower mental health literacy (i. e., the ability to identify mental health problems and treatments according to the dominant conceptualizations) (Adams et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and aging stigma (Allen &amp; Sikora, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Concerns about stigma are common in older adults in general; however, they may be more pronounced for older adults who are also part of minoritized racial, ethnic, and sexual groups (Inventor et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In any diverse population, lower mental health literacy and stigma may impact the assessment of depressive disorders in rapport building between the clinician and client, and in symptom reporting in multiple ways, including rapport building and symptom reporting (i. e., whether symptoms are reported and how they are described).</para>
      <para role="Para">Three strategies during the initial rapport-building phase may mitigate these concerns and maximize information gathering with older adults and diverse groups: (1) carefully informing the client of the purpose of the assessment and what to expect during the assessment process, (2) reducing stigma through empathetic responses, and (3) practicing cultural humility and maintaining cultural competence to facilitate the rapport-building process. First, it is important to ascertain the clients’ understanding of why they are seeing the clinician and to provide them with all relevant information about the purpose of the assessment. Similarly, the interviewer should inform clients about what to expect, such as length of the assessment, types of information that will be sought, rationale for the information being asked of the client, from whom information will be sought (including gathering appropriate permissions), and how the assessment results will be used and reported back to the client. Some clients may be concerned about the outcomes of the assessment (e. g., hospitalization, competency or legal issues) or concerned about the protection of their confidentiality, so the clinician needs to carefully discuss the potential outcomes of the assessment and what information will be shared with whom.</para>
      <para role="Para">Stigma concerns may be reduced by empathizing with the client’s symptoms or situation, viewing distress as common or understandable in some difficult situations. For example, while assessing mood symptoms with an older caregiver who has recently placed their partner in a long-term care facility, the clinician may note that caregivers often feel guilty, worrying that they “didn’t do enough,” thus normalizing and recognizing the difficult emotions involved in caregiving and role transitions. This may allow the caregiver to further open up more about experiences of guilt as well as other depressive symptoms.</para>
      <para role="Para">Finally, practicing cultural humility may increase alliance in the clinician-client relationship and further facilitate an open discussion about depressive symptoms and assessment. Broadly, cultural humility is an evolving process including self-examining one’s own cultural awareness, providing interpersonal respect, addressing power imbalances, and an openness to new cultural information (Mosher et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Research indicates that clinicians who adopt a framework of cultural humility experience stronger therapeutic relationships and are less likely to encounter or contribute to microaggressions when working with diverse clients (Davis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>), highlighting the importance of considering diversity factors in all assessment interactions. Of note, cultural humility involves acknowledging all sources of individual diversity, including (but not limited to): race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or values.</para>

      <title>Use of Standardized Assessment</title>
      <para role="Para">Standardized diagnostic and screening tools that have been validated for diverse populations are a critical component of diagnostic interviewing. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide a comprehensive review of all potential measures, it is critical to examine the evidence of validity with diverse populations prior to selecting measures. Some tools have become well-established with diverse populations. For example, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) has shown very good validity in relation to expert clinician interviews and has been used with a wide range of samples, including primary care and other medical patients, individuals from various cultural backgrounds (e. g., diverse populations within the United States, including Latinx and African-American; Nigerian; Thai; Korean; Chinese) (Huang et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>), and older adults (Phelan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="ch0008s0006s03" role="Heading">
      <title>Supplementing Standardized Assessment with a Cultural Formulation</title>
      <para role="Para">Despite the value of standardized tools, the individual’s cultural context must be considered while formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan. Cultural context is important to assess, given that clients’ culture impacts all aspects of their help-seeking, including their perceptions of their problems, causes, and potential solutions, and their relationships with providers. It is also important that clinicians recognize that cultural identity is complex and may change over time. For example, a client may strongly identify with both their country of origin and the majority culture in which they live in, or they may identify with neither, with not clear relationship between the two. Instead of assuming a “zero-sum model,” in which the person is viewed as high on one dimension of identity and low on the other, a client may have a low or high sense of identity on each dimension. Immigration status is another important part of cultural identity that may impact distress and stressors. For example, research has shown that the rate of depression in immigrant individuals is lower than that of native-born individuals when they arrive in the United States, but that their risk for psychological distress increases with time spent in the United States (Ikonte et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Cultural factors also influence how individuals conceptualize and report their mood symptoms. For example, Hispanic-American adults tend to emphasize somatic symptoms more so than emotional or mood-related symptoms, and are less likely to distinguish between mood and somatic symptoms (Lewis-Fernández et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A similar pattern has been found with older adults, who may present with more somatic symptoms, including a focus on physical health conditions, agitation, or gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as more anhedonia and fewer depressed or mood-focused symptoms (Hegeman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Individuals may also use terms of descriptions not found within the <emphasis>DSM-5</emphasis> to label their symptoms. For example, Spanish-speaking patients may use a variety of terms to describe their distress or depressive symptoms, such as “desanimado” (discouraged) or “nervios” (Noguera et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). There are also mixed findings on whether Black Americans experience more or less depression as compared to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts, suggesting that the relationship between race and depression is multi-dimensional, and accurate assessment should include assessing for social context, lived experiences (such as systemic racism and discrimination), and individual descriptions of depressive symptoms (Ettman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Thus, in assessing and diagnosing depressive disorders, clinicians would use a biopsychosocial conceptualization, validate reported somatic symptoms, and maintain cultural competence.</para>
      <para role="Para">To introduce a simplified approach for integrating cultural considerations into assessment across disciplines, the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) was published in 2013 (Lewis-Fernández et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The CFI is a semi-structured interview, which was developed based on literature review and field trials in the United States, Canada, India, Kenya, the Netherlands, and Peru. It includes 16 core questions to systematically assess four dimensions: cultural identity of the individual (e. g., reference group, acculturation across host and origin cultures, language), cultural explanations of illness (e. g., idioms and symptom presentation, meaning of illness in relation to cultural norms, perceived explanatory models), cultural factors related to psychosocial environment and levels of functioning (e. g., interpretations of stressors, social networks), and cultural elements of the client-clinician relationship (Lewis-Fernández et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In addition, the CFI includes 12 supplemental modules that can be used to gather more information; the modules for older adults, immigrants and refugees, and caregivers might be particularly relevant for assessment with diverse older adults and their families. The questions are open-ended, and the authors conceptualize the CFI as a person-centered, ethnographic approach that allows patients to describe their problems, explanations, and experiences in their own words.</para>
      <para role="Para">The CFI begins by asking about the patient’s (or informant’s) perspective regarding the presenting problem, its causes, helpful supports, and stressors that make the problem worse. The next set of questions asks about the patient’s cultural identity and how it relates to their problems. Subsequent questions ask about coping strategies the patient has tried and how the patient has sought help (formal or informal) from others. The final questions ask about preferences for future assistance and any concerns or observations the patient has about their relationship with the clinician. The questions are written in plain language, with instructions that there is no “right” answer, and include definitions for some terms.</para>
      <para role="Para">Adding the CFI or other questions to assess cultural considerations is a valuable supplement to the standard diagnostic assessment tools, even those that have been validated with diverse populations. Research has provided evidence that the CFI is effective in improving clinical rapport (Lewis-Fernández et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>), as well as assisting clinicians with differential diagnosis and treatment planning with diverse populations (Aggarwal, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In addition, assessing patients’ multidimensional needs, such as housing, environment, physical, and social needs, also helps the clinician gain a better understanding of the full scope of a client’s presenting problem and how their needs may relate to symptoms of depressive disorders.</para>

      <title>Biopsychosocial Assessment</title>
      <para role="Para">Individuals from underserved populations frequently have complex, multidimensional problems associated with a depressive disorder. Such problems may include physical illness and limitations, limited income, poor social support networks, and unsafe or unstable housing situations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>situations</primary>
         </indexterm>. These individuals also may view depressive symptoms in relation to these other difficulties, complicating the identification of symptoms. For example, a client who is unemployed and of low income may primarily discuss their concerns related to job-seeking, rather than their mood symptoms. Alternatively, an older adult may talk about their loneliness rather than depression. Thus, to fully explore depressive symptoms and develop a comprehensive treatment plan, the clinician needs to conduct an assessment of the clients’ multidimensional needs.</para>
      <para role="Para">Older adults with depression have been found to experience significantly more unmet needs across multiple domains (environmental, physical, psychological, social) compared to older adults without depression (Stein et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>), underscoring the importance of supplementing mood evaluations with an assessment of other needs. In fact, addressing the multidimensional needs of older adults<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>adults</primary>
         </indexterm> who have low income and depressive symptoms with thorough case management may be sufficient for alleviating depressive symptoms, without psychotherapy or other interventions for depression (Areán et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>), which has important implications for treatment planning.</para>

      <title>Adjusting Assessment Procedures</title>
      <para role="Para">In addition to assessing a client’s multidimensional needs, the interviewer may need to adjust the assessment process to accommodate these needs. For example, the clinician may need to be flexible regarding time of day and location for meeting, such as if the client has other responsibilities such as work or caregiving, is dependent on others for transportation, or has physical or sensory limitations that limit the ability to travel to certain clinical settings. For a client with communication difficulties, the clinician may want to consider multimodal communication strategies, such as written cues or oral administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires. For a client with physical limitations, the clinician should inquire about the client’s best time of day and may need to schedule breaks or assessments across multiple time periods.</para>
