   <title>Collateral Interview</title>
   <para role="Para">Many clients will be effective and accurate historians, able to provide enough detail about their presenting concerns to satisfy the purposes of the interview<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>interview</primary>
      </indexterm>. However, some clients, such as young children or those with neurocognitive difficulties, may not be able to provide adequate information to inform the diagnostic process. In these cases, interviewing collateral informants can be useful for obtaining additional information. The best informants are those people who know the client well or who have the most accurate and updated information about the client’s presenting problem and personal history. The referral question may dictate the types of information needed from collaterals. For example, issues about childhood development may necessitate interviewing the child’s caregivers and teachers. Referral questions related to neurocognitive difficulties in older adults may require interviewing the client’s spouse/partner, adult children, or caregivers<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>caregivers</primary>
      </indexterm>. The clinician should rely on their clinical skills when determining whom to interview for additional information about the client’s presenting problems and history.</para>
   <para role="Para">After the initial interview with the client, the clinician should obtain permission to interview additional informants. Clinicians should maintain client confidentiality during the collateral interview, keeping the discussion focused on the informant’s perspectives of the situation and not disclosing information shared by the client to the informant. When conducting the collateral interview, clinicians should remember<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>remember</primary>
      </indexterm>that informants may have motivations or biases that could affect the assessment outcomes (e. g., paid caregivers, desires to protect the client from stigma, etc.). Clinicians should listen for underlying motivations that may influence the reliability of the informant’s report. At the onset of the collateral interview, the clinician should explain the limits to confidentiality and establish how well the informant knows the client. The clinician should also be clear in explaining the purpose of the interview. Some collateral informants experience distress related to the client’s presenting problems and may attempt to steer the conversation to their mental or physical health concerns. The clinician should use empathy in these situations, noting the functional effects of the client’s symptoms and behaviors, while focusing the interview on obtaining information about the client.</para>
   <para role="Para">During the collateral interview, the clinician should ask questions about any areas that were unclear in the client’s interview and inquire about the informant’s perception of the client’s symptoms and behaviors, their beliefs about factors influencing the presenting problem, and additional details from the client’s history<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>history</primary>
      </indexterm>, including trauma exposure, substance use, prior physical and mental health diagnoses, and previous treatment the client may not have disclosed. Collateral informants can provide useful information about the client’s personality (or personality changes), current and past levels of functioning, and behavioral effects about which the client may have limited or absent insight.</para>
