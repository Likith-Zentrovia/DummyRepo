   <title>Recommendations for Formal Assessment</title>
   <para role="Para">We highly recommend that clinicians include some type of formal assessment (in addition to unstructured clinical interviewing) as a part of their routine assessment practice for clients with an ED. Approximately 30% of disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>disorders</primary>
      </indexterm> can be missed by the interviewer if unstructured interviews are administered without any formal diagnostic interview (Zimmerman &amp; Mattia, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1999</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Other research indicates that early response in the first month of treatment as defined by 2.88% weight gain (for persons with AN) or ≥70% reduction in binge eating or purging (for persons with BED or BN) is one of the only prognostic indicators for end-of-treatment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>end-of-treatment</primary>
      </indexterm> response (Chang et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2021</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Thus, formal assessment may help clinicians better understand the full diagnostic picture to inform case conceptualization, identify prognosis by monitoring early response, and make evidence-based decisions about the optimal timing and necessity of stepped care. Overall, clinicians who engage in routine assessment of cognitions and behaviors can treat clients faster and more effectively (Lewis et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2019</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Clinicians who are routinely assessing at intake and throughout treatment, therefore, have a better likelihood of seeing meaningful improvements in their clients.</para>
   <para role="Para">Given that many<indexterm significance="normal">

         <phrase>2023</phrase>

   <para role="Para">The selected measures (see below) do not represent an exhaustive list of assessments from which to choose.

Strengths of the EDE-Q include strong reliability and internal consistency.

Three scales—Drive for Thinness, Body Dissatisfaction, and Bulimia—directly pertain to EDs, whereas the other nine scales assess correlated psychopathology (e. g., Maturity Fears, Perfectionism, Emotion Dysregulation, etc.). Although the EDI-3 has good reliability and convergent validity (Brookings et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
