   <title>Dos and Don’ts</title>
   <para role="Para">As mentioned earlier, many patients with SSRD have undergone a long history of partly disappointing interactions with the healthcare system. Clinicians conducting interviews with individuals with SSRD should be aware that the diagnostic sessions do not just have the purpose to make a diagnosis but to build a therapeutic relationship and to facilitate patients’ readiness to adopt an interdisciplinary treatment approach including psychological interventions. The following Dos and Don’ts shall help guide clinicians through the diagnostic process.</para>

      <title>Dos</title>
      <para role="Para">Reflect on your own emotions toward patients with persistent somatic symptoms. If you observe negative emotions and attitudes, first think about how you can handle them. Demonstrate genuine interest in your way of asking questions and understanding the patient. Validate the reality of the symptom severity and interference. Although the diagnostic sessions focus on making a diagnosis, it is helpful for patients to be aware of what psychology can offer and what it cannot. Be transparent about patients’ proactive role in the therapeutic process. Use the opportunity that patients have often not been taken seriously and that you now provide time to understand them. Patients also have a strong need to find explanations for their symptoms. For patients, finding causes usually is the first step to finding a successful treatment. Be validating toward patients’ needs, but at the same time do not get involved in unfruitful, frustrating discussions of symptom attributions and potential causes. Introduce psychotherapy as a “second treatment path,” which opens new perspectives and approaches in addition to the approaches the patient has already applied. Apply techniques from the Motivational Interviewing approach (e. g., ask open questions, active listening, validation, summarizing) (Miller &amp; Rollnick,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In case the patient has a known medical condition, inform yourself about it. Gain the patient’s consent to contact other healthcare providers involved in the patient’s treatment and access to the patient’s medical file. Emphasize the patient’s autonomy in decision-making and if they want to move on with a psychological treatment. Keep an open mind regarding etiology: maybe the symptom cannot be completely explained under the current circumstances. This does not mean that there will be no explanations in the future. Most important is that the patient currently does not only focus on the intensity of the symptom but also on how distressing the symptom is and the negative impact it has.</para>

      <title>Don’ts</title>
      <para role="Para">Don’t tell patients that they “will have to live with it” or that “symptoms are produced in their mind or brain.” Don’t use terms that imply a biopsychosocial nature of the symptom too early in the interaction with the patient, such as “psychosomatic,” “psychogenic,” “somatoform,” or “psychological/mental.” Don’t make decisions for the patient or fall into body-mind dichotomous thinking (e. g., “We cannot find a medical cause, for this reason your symptom is psychosomatic”). Avoid providing reassurance that your patient does not have an organic disease.</para>
