   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">When conducting<indexterm significance="normal">

      </indexterm> an assessment for personality disorder, whether using a categorical or dimensional model, certain key information must be clarified prior to reaching<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>reaching</primary>
      </indexterm> a diagnostic decision. This section highlights the importance of assessing each presenting symptom in addition to gathering important contextual information during assessments in attempts to comprehensively understand a patient and their concerns. First, as mentioned in previous sections, personality assessments can include multiple sources of information. This is a key component of a psychological evaluation. For example, evaluating clinicians should gather as much information as possible about a patient’s presenting concern from clinical interviews, self-reports, informant reports, objective testing, and behavioral observations. Although including all may not be possible<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>possible</primary>
      </indexterm>, clinicians should aim to make diagnostic decisions informed by multiple sources and instruments.</para>
   <para role="Para">When assessing PDs or any psychopathology there are several key factors clinicians must assess. First, clinicians should assess the onset, course, severity, and duration of each symptom. Next, assessing functioning or impairment is particularly important when formulating a psychological assessment. In addition<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>addition</primary>
      </indexterm> to functioning, culturally relevant factors or personal identity are also key in clinical decision-making. This is because a comparative reference group may not accurately represent minoritized identities or cultures, potentially over-pathologizing or ignoring the impact of institutionalized or systemic harms and how these impact a client’s functioning. Thus, the heterogeneous presentation of any psychopathology should be carefully considered. Furthermore, family medical and psychiatric history is also important to know as personality disorders exhibit heritability ranges between 35% and 60% (Reichborn-Kjennerud, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2010</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The developmental history of the<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>the</primary>
      </indexterm> client is important in informing the onset of the symptoms of a PD, such as traumatic or adverse events (Swales, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Finally, psychosocial factors may help identify events that led to the onset of symptoms.</para>
   <para role="Para">In addition to assessing symptoms, functioning, and culturally relevant behaviors, psychosocial factors such as physical health should be assessed. For example, a client’s physical health can be especially critical to making a diagnosis. The client’s physical health such as medical conditions and medication use<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>use</primary>
      </indexterm> can help rule out or explain some symptoms or provide information regarding comorbid conditions to consider. Additionally, the client’s lifestyle factors such as substance use can also be informative to rule out factors that are impacting the client’s symptoms.</para>
   <para role="Para">Finally, consulting with the existing<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>existing</primary>
      </indexterm>diagnostic criteria of PDs is key when assessing for a personality disorder. If using categorical diagnostic criteria, it is important to consider the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms and the ways that these symptoms can be expressed. The context in which the symptoms are present is also helpful to know when making a diagnosis because it can help establish a current pattern of when, where, and how the symptoms occur. Current contexts may include major life events, life stressors, recent life changes, or work or school environment. If using dimensional models for diagnosis, these contexts are also important to consider, but the severity of symptom impact may also be especially considered here. In order to apply diagnostic criteria appropriately, knowing the different presentation of the diagnostic<indexterm significance="normal">
