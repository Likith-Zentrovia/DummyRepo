   <title>Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">When assessing a client for an anxiety disorder, there are many individual factors (e. g., gender, culture, age) that may impact the presentation and assessment of the disorder. Awareness and consideration of these factors may help increase the validity of a suggested diagnosis, especially for individuals whose identities may have been historically underrepresented in clinical research.</para>
   <para role="Para">The degree to which the interviewer and client differ in cultural (and subcultural) background, and in their positionality in society, the interviewer should hold their conceptualization of the client’s problems lightly. This conceptualization includes the two-component behavioral framework described here. Our understandings of the world (including our social world) attempt to reduce complexity to more manageable within the limits of human cognition; the DSM and behavioral two-component frameworks are reductionistic. Awareness of the potential usefulness of these frameworks should be balanced with an awareness of their limitations as cultural constructs.</para>
   <para role="Para">Even after the assessment is complete, the imperfect reliability of our diagnostic procedures warrants viewing the diagnosis as provisional, subject to confirmation or correction using information from the client during therapy. The diagnosis of anxiety disorders, and the behavioral conceptualization that is implied by the diagnostic label, can be viewed as a frame that is possibly useful to the client. The diagnosis should not be reified. It is descriptive, and like any description, it is incomplete. Clinicians are typically in positions of power over clients, positions that include expertise if not authority. The positionality that comes with the roles of clinician and client creates the potential for the clinician’s pronouncements to negate the client’s experience. Therapy can be viewed as the process by which the client can learn about a new conceptualization of their problem, but the client is the ultimate arbitrator as to whether that new conceptualization is useful to them. During therapy, the clinician can invite the client to engage in new behaviors to find out if the new conceptualization fits with their experiences. Clinicians need not abandon their beliefs in order to adopt a collaborative approach—they should have humility about the complexity of the human experience and about their own beliefs.</para>

      <title>Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation</title>
      <para role="Para">Research has found that women are almost twice as likely as men to receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder over their lifetime (Mc Lean et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, there does not appear to be any gender differences in the age of onset and chronology of anxiety disorders (Mc Lean et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The gender difference in the prevalence of anxiety disorders is often described via the vulnerability-stress model. This biological predisposition (Lebron-Milad &amp; Milad, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) is then paired with experiences of gender-role socialization, increased reported life stress for women, and the use of emotion-focus coping to further explain the sex differences in anxiety disorders (Matud, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2004</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, there is the risk of gender bias in client reporting of symptoms in which men may be less willing to disclose feelings of anxiety due to gendered socialization which taught them that these feelings were not acceptable for men (Hallers-Haalboom et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender (LGBT)<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender (LGBT)</primary>
         </indexterm> individuals have also been found to report higher rates of anxiety than their straight or cisgender peers (Reisner et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The minority stress model theorizes that this increased risk is due to additional environmental stress resulting from factors like discrimination, stigma, and structural inequity due to heteronormativity leading to higher rates of anxiety (Meyer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2003</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Transgender youth have also been found to report significantly higher rates of GAD compared to their cisgender peers (Chodzen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This relationship is believed to be particularly strong for transgender youth who reported thoughts of internalized transphobia. Clinicians should be cognizant of the increased risk of anxiety disorders for women and LGBT individuals and the potential predisposition for underreporting of symptoms in men when considering a diagnosis.</para>

      <title>Older Adults</title>
      <para role="Para">Anxiety disorders are generally found to be less common for older adults compared to younger adults (Wolitzky-Taylor et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, despite this overall decrease in prevalence as a function of age, anxiety disorders are still one of the most diagnosed disorders in older individuals. Assessment for anxiety disorders is often more difficult than for younger adults due to differences in how older adults describe anxiety, higher rates of medical comorbidities that complicate or mask diagnosis, and cognitive changes due to age-related decline (Balsamo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Older adults are less likely to discuss their negative emotions or select absolute descriptors like “never” and “always” when completing self-report measures (Balsamo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, compared to younger adults, older adults are more likely to report feelings of shame and guilt related to anxiety disorder rather than feelings of fear. Due to these known differences in the presentation of anxiety disorder in older adults, specific self-report measures have been developed to assess anxiety in this population. The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (Pachana et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>), Geriatric Anxiety Scale (Segal et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>), and Worry Scale (Wisocki et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1986</phrase>
         </emphasis>) are well-supported self-report measures for assessing anxiety symptoms in older adults.</para>

      <title>Children and Adolescents</title>
      <para role="Para">A recent national survey found that 7.8% of children ages 3 to 17 in the United States reported symptoms of a current anxiety disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> (US Department of Commerce, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Some diagnoses are found almost exclusively in children including selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder. When assessing symptoms of anxiety disorders in children, it is important to be aware of behaviors like tantrums, irritability, and crying which may be misattributed to disobedience rather than<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>than</primary>
         </indexterm> an anxiety disorder. Distress and avoidance manifest in varied forms, and that variation is greater among populations with less developed verbal abilities and skills. Children are also more likely to report physiological symptoms of anxiety like headaches and gastrointestinal distress (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, children may have a hard time identifying their avoidant behaviors, so reports from parents and teachers may be particularly important. Developmentally appropriate fears and worries should not be considered as evidence of an anxiety disorder. Measures specifically designed for assessing anxiety disorders in children include the Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAMS-5; Martinez-Snyder et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Muris et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>

   <sect2 id="ch0010s0006s04" role="Heading">
      <title>Race and Culture</title>
      <para role="Para">Previous research has found that White Americans were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders compared to Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans (Asnaani et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This finding was found even when controlling for the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of the participants. In the same study, Asian Americans were the least likely to report an anxiety disorder. Additionally, individuals who immigrated to the United States were found to have lower rates of GAD than those born in the United States (Budhwani et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, the study also found that experiences of racial or ethnic discrimination were significantly associated with an increased risk of GAD. The increased stress experienced by racial or ethnic minority individuals in the United States from experiences of discrimination and transgenerational passing of stress is hypothesized to increase the risk that an individual will develop an anxiety disorder (Thoits, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, the differences between diagnosis rates of anxiety disorders may be due to lower utilization of mental healthcare services by Black and Hispanic individuals compared to White individuals in the United States (De Luca et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Some descriptions of anxiety are culturally bound. In the Culture and Psychiatric Diagnosis section of the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis>, there are examples of some of these culturally based concepts for describing or understanding distress which clients may reference (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For instance, <emphasis>nervios</emphasis> is a term used in many Latinx communities to describe a range of symptoms including headaches, nervousness, gastrointestinal disturbance, emotional distress, and inability to complete tasks (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, the <emphasis>DSM-5-TR</emphasis> identifies some culture-bound disorders that share some similarities to the disorders described in the anxiety section of the book. A diagnosis of <emphasis>taijin kyofusho</emphasis> may be more descriptive than social anxiety disorder for an individual from Japan who expresses anxiety around social interactions due to a fear that their appearance or odor will offend others.</para>

      <title>Socioeconomic Status</title>
      <para role="Para">Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be associated with high rates of anxiety disorders and poorer treatment outcomes (Nunes et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additionally, low neighborhood income and high crime rates were also associated with elevated levels of general anxiety (Finegan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Longitudinal research suggests that both growing up in poverty and experiencing life events that result<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>result</primary>
         </indexterm> in increased financial hardship are predictors for developing a variety of negative mental health outcomes including increased anxiety (Ridley et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities often function to sustain anxiety disorder through financial barriers to treatments, increased worry about finances, and potentially higher rates of exposure to crime near the home (Ridley et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>

      <title>Intersections of Identities</title>
      <para role="Para">Many clients hold one or more of the identities referenced in this section. It is important for clinicians to be aware of how intersecting identities may impact the frequency and presentation of anxiety disorders. For example, the previously identified sex differences in diagnosed anxiety disorders have been shown to decrease for individuals over the age of 65 notably. This change in prevalence is hypothesized to be due to a number of factors including the impact of mortality-related anxiety<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>anxiety</primary>

            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). During the assessment process, the clinician should consider the client’s identity as a whole within their current context to develop a more comprehensive case conceptualization and diagnosis.</para>
