   <title>Social History</title>
   <para role="Para">There is not one “correct” approach to assessing social history (which is also sometimes called a psychosocial history)<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>psychosocial history)</primary>
      </indexterm>. Some clinicians may want to inquire about a client’s social history through a developmental lens, beginning with infancy and progressing through the current stage of life. Others may structure inquiry around specific themes relevant to the presenting problem. Not all aspects of a client’s social history will be relevant to the diagnostic process. As a general practice, clinicians should inquire about a broad scope of information followed by more specific inquiries as needed. We discuss some of the key areas of a social history next.</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Cultural Identity</title>
      <para role="Para">Integrating cultural context and identity throughout the clinical interview is an ethical responsibility and a necessary part of person-centered assessment and treatment. Keeping in mind that cultural identity is not a unidimensional construct, the clinician should inquire about a client’s race, ethnicity, cultural identity and background, geographic location, age, disability, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, language spoken at home, nationality, religion, educational history, socioeconomic status, military or Veteran culture. Regardless of which domains of cultural identity<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>cultural identity</primary>
         </indexterm> the client endorses, taking a person-centered culturally informed approach, using the client’s terminology, attempting to understand how the various aspects of a client’s identity affect day-to-day life, attending to one’s own cultural biases, and developing attitudes and behaviors that convey a value of cultural sensitivity will likely increase rapport and help the client feel understood through the evaluation and treatment process. Further, considering cultural identity during the clinical interview helps to reduce the risk of over-pathologizing symptoms and behaviors that may fall within a normal or acceptable range within an individual’s culture (see the Cultural Concepts of Distress section in the DSM-5-TR). In neuropsychological evaluations<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>evaluations</primary>
         </indexterm>, the use of normative data requires information about the client’s level of education, primary language, country of origin, and race or ethnicity. Failing to account for a client’s cultural identity status can lead to misdiagnosis and potential harm.</para>
      <para role="Para">The clinician may not need to inquire about each cultural domain during the interview if information has already been provided on self-report demographic background forms. Any areas that may impact mental health should be discussed. Because some areas of cultural identity may be sensitive if addressed directly, it is recommended that clinicians begin with open-ended questions rather than assuming identity status or asking directly (e. g., “I’d like to hear a bit about your cultural background” versus “What is your ethnicity?”). Some researchers and professional organizations have provided guidelines<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>guidelines</primary>
         </indexterm> and resources for understanding and integrating culture into mental health assessment and practice (see SAMHSA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>; “The Cultural Formulation Interview, APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). At a minimum, clinicians should use the ADDRESSING model (age/generational influences, developmental or other disability, religion or spiritual orientation, ethnic and racial identity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, Indigenous heritage, national origin, and gender; Hays, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>), which is an efficient method to inquire about the complex and intersecting aspects of a client’s identity.</para>

         <title>Age and Generational Influences</title>
         <para role="Para">Though a client’s chronological age can be obtained from their date of birth, clinicians should understand that age is more than the number. Factors to consider when inquiring about age include the client’s perception of how old they feel (subjective age), life stage, generational roles, experiences specific to their cohort, and other cultural influences on aging expectations. A clinician may ask questions such as “How old do you feel,” “What factors influence your subjective age,” and “What historical events occurred during your lifetime that impact the way you have aged or the way you feel about your age?”</para>

      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s02" role="Heading">
         <title>Developmental or Other Disability</title>
         <para role="Para">A disability may occur at any stage of life, and not all disabilities are visible. Thus, the clinician should sensitively ask about those disabilities that are apparent (e. g., stuttering, missing limbs) and any that may not be apparent (e. g., cognitive or learning disorders). Clinicians should inquire about experienced difficulties, the developmental stage at which the disability occurred, coping strategies, and the effects of any conditions reported.</para>

      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s03" role="Heading">
         <title>Religion and Spiritual Orientation</title>
         <para role="Para">The clinician should inquire about religious or spiritual practices during all developmental stages. Clients may have been raised within a specific religion but may change their values over time. Understanding the factors surrounding any change in faith systems could be important as it may affect current social support and values/ethics systems.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s04" role="Heading">
         <title>Ethnic and Racial Identity</title>
         <para role="Para">Though clients may indicate they are part of a specific ethnic or racial group, the clinician should remember that many cultural<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>cultural</primary>
            </indexterm> groups are made up of sub-groups. For clients not part of the majority status, it is important to inquire about ethnic and racial identity, as well as the effects of racism and other oppressive attitudes the client has experienced.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s05" role="Heading">
         <title>Socioeconomic Status</title>
         <para role="Para">Several factors influence a client’s past and current socioeconomic status (SES). The primary contributing factors include education level, occupation, and income. When evaluating SES, the clinician should inquire about the client’s access to resources in their history and the present. Any notable resource changes<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>changes</primary>
            </indexterm>(increases or decreases) can create stress and strain a client’s coping system. Rather than asking directly about SES, clinicians should inquire about related factors (e. g., economic status, housing stability, food security, and access to technology).</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s06" role="Heading">
         <title>Gender and Sexual Orientation</title>
         <para role="Para">Gender and sexual orientation are important aspects of identity for many clients, and sensitivity should be used during the interview process. When exploring gender identity, clinicians should ask about sex assigned at birth, current gender identity, and changes in gender identity over time. Regarding sexual orientation, clinicians should ask clients about their preferences for sexual partners (e. g., asexual; preference for sexual activity with others of the same or different gender, etc.). Clients should also be asked about experiences with heterosexism and other oppressive attitudes the client may have experienced.</para>

         <title>Indigenous Heritage</title>
         <para role="Para">Many Indigenous people identify as part of a worldwide culture with concerns that differ from factors unique to ethnicity and race. Thus, in the ADDRESSING model, Indigenous heritage is listed as a unique aspect of cultural identity<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>identity</primary>
            </indexterm>, rather than as part of ethnicity and race (Hayes, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2016</phrase>
            </emphasis>). For clients who report Indigenous heritage, clinicians should ask what percentage of Indigenous heritage they claim. Clinicians should also inquire about any historical effects the client has directly experienced, or indirect effects of historical events on the client’s family.</para>

      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s01s08" role="Heading">
         <title>National Origin and Primary Language</title>
         <para role="Para">In recent years, global migration has increased, with 281 million people seeking new opportunities, searching for safety, refuge, or to avoid conflict. Migration history and acculturative stress are important to consider, as they can be associated with mental (e. g., PTSD, increased suicide risk) and physical health problems. Conversely, migration is also associated with strengths that will be useful in treatment planning. Clinicians should inquire about the client’s country of origin and immigration timeline, acculturation process, and the effects of microaggressions or other oppressive attitude experienced. Clients should also be asked about their primary language, whether they are fluent in other languages, and any difficulties related to language differences (e. g., in educational or occupational settings).</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s02" role="Heading">
      <title>Family of Origin History</title>
      <para role="Para">How a clinician structures the discussion about the client’s family of origin will depend on the referral question and the presenting problem. For some interviews, gathering basic information about the client’s family background will be adequate (e. g., referral questions evaluating cognitive status), and others will necessitate more in-depth inquiry (e. g., child custody evaluations). The concept of “family” varies. Clinicians should be careful not to make assumptions, using the client’s language as relevant. The goal of inquiries about a client’s family of origin is to learn about the family composition, relationships, and how the family system affected the client in the past and the present. At a minimum, the clinician should inquire about family members, their roles, ages, interactions, and changes over time. Additionally, if not already discussed during the interview, the clinician should inquire about the client’s history of potentially traumatic experiences, including neglect and emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.</para>
      <para role="Para">As with other domains, the clinician should begin with open-ended questions followed by more specific inquiries as needed (e. g., “Tell me about your family when you were growing up,” “Who lived in your household when you were a child?”). Rather than initially asking about a client’s parents, the clinician may want to ask who raised the client or filled parental roles. Information should be obtained about the client’s relationship with their parents or caregivers, their occupations (past and present), and history of major physical and mental health problems. Similar information should be obtained about any siblings or other children living in the home, in addition to the birth order and the client’s place in the birth order. The clinician may want to inquire about other people who lived with the client or were influential to them.</para>
      <para role="Para">In addition to gathering basic information about the client’s family of origin and relationships, the clinician may also want to explore family functioning, including disciplinary practices, communication patterns between family members, values around showing affection, family traditions, the effects of mental or physical health problems within the family (including addictions), and general values (e. g., value placed on formal education).</para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s03" role="Heading">
      <title>Current Family Status</title>
      <para role="Para">Conversations about a client’s family of origin naturally evolve into discussions about current family status. This line of inquiry is intended to learn about the client’s current family support system, including composition, relationships, and effects of the family system. Again, for some referral questions, gathering basic information will be adequate; for others, comprehensive information will be needed. Clinicians should use cultural sensitivity when discussing current family status (e. g., use of the term “partner” versus “spouse”).</para>
      <para role="Para">The clinician may begin this line of inquiry by asking about the client’s history of all serious relationships, including a timeline (e. g., client’s age during the relationship, dates for beginning and end), legal outcomes (e. g., marriage, divorce), reasons for relationship terminations, and current relationship status. For clients currently in committed relationships, the clinician should inquire about the relationship status and quality, whether the client has children, division of responsibility, patterns of stress and support between the partners, and conflict management. When clients report a history of divorce, the clinician should inquire about the divorce terms, including financial arrangements, visitation schedules, and the decision-making process for any children. For clients assigned female at birth, the clinician should inquire about pregnancy history, including whether the client has ever been pregnant, the number of pregnancies, and whether they ever experienced pregnancy loss (e. g., miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion). For clients with children, the clinician should inquire about whether the children live with the client, current relationship status, and child-rearing practices.</para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s04" role="Heading">
      <title>Personal History</title>
      <para role="Para">Many aspects of the client’s personal history may have been obtained in earlier stages of the interview. As relevant to the referral question, the clinician may also want to inquire about other developmental milestones from the client’s infancy to their current life stage. The client may not be able to recall details of early life stages. The clinician should prompt the client to share what they can remember, providing cues for recall as needed.</para>
      <sect3 id="ch0004s0007s04s01" role="Heading">
         <title>Infancy and Childhood</title>
         <para role="Para">Unless out of the ordinary events occurred for the client in infancy, they may not have been told about early developmental milestones. The clinician should inquire about whether the client’s birth mother experienced complications during pregnancy or delivery, whether the client was born full-term or premature, and if they met developmental milestones at the expected time (e. g., walking, talking, toileting, etc.).</para>
         <para role="Para">When inquiring about the client’s childhood experiences, the goal is to explore factors related to early social development. The clinician may want to ask about the client’s earliest memories and impactful childhood experiences, childhood health history, early peer relationships, elementary school experiences, difficulties adjusting to school, learning disabilities, and activities the client enjoyed as a child (e. g., sports or organized programs).</para>

         <title>Adolescence</title>

               <primary>history</primary>
            </indexterm>. Some areas of inquiry include notable experiences with puberty (e. g., timeline and challenges), dating and romantic history, sexual development, peer relationships, episodes of acting out (e. g., use of drugs, promiscuity, or criminal behavior), educational experiences, and participation in activities. When discussing the client’s romantic and sexual history, the clinician should be sensitive to the client’s cultural identity, not assuming a heterosexual development or imposing on the client’s religious values, if applicable. Clients may be reluctant to share information about their sexual development. To reduce discomfort, the clinician should inquire<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>inquire</primary>
            </indexterm> in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner, indicating that discussion of sensitive topics, including sexuality, is accepted in the setting and for a thorough understanding of the client’s history.</para>

         <title>Early and Middle Adulthood</title>
         <para role="Para">The stages of young and middle adulthood pose unique challenges. Clinicians should inquire about broad developmental concerns and the client’s adjustment to stage-specific issues (e. g., intimacy versus isolation for younger adults; generativity versus stagnation or self-absorption for middle-aged adults). The client’s adult relationship history may have been covered when discussing their current family status. If not previously discussed, the clinician should inquire about relationship history, status, and quality of relationships. Areas of additional interest include educational and occupational history, social support systems, the effect of work on daily life, economic stability, hobbies and interests, and satisfaction with life goals. Clients in this life stage often experience stressors related to being part of the “sandwich” generation, meaning they care for both children and aging parents. Clinicians should inquire about challenges clients may experience if part of the sandwich generation and attempt to understand how they balance the expectations of each responsibility.</para>

         <title>Late Adulthood</title>
         <para role="Para">Aging adults experience unique changes compared to other life stages (see Segal et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
               <phrase>2018</phrase>
            </emphasis>). In addition to other developmental history information, it is important to ask about common life experiences occurring during this life stage, such as retirement, family changes, support systems, grief and loss, illness and disability<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>disability</primary>
            </indexterm>, death and dying, and adjustment to age-related changes. It is critical to understand the differences between normal aging and pathological changes. For example, memory difficulties are common among aging adults and, though unpleasant, may represent normal aging rather than a pathological dementia process. Clinicians should also note that aging adults are still sexually active and should be asked about their current sexual function, including interest, performance, and difficulties.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s05" role="Heading">
      <title>Current Social Support Systems</title>
      <para role="Para">The clinician should ask about the client’s current support system, if not previously covered, with specific inquiry about who the client can rely on for support in multiple situations, such as for fun, in a crisis, or at work. Not all support comes through in-person encounters. Clinicians may also want to inquire about online social support (e. g., for home-bound clients who obtain support from social media sources). Because relationships provide both support and a source of stress, clients should also be asked if there are people, places, or things that are supportive or harmful to their overall well-being.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0004s0007s06" role="Heading">
      <title>Social Media Use</title>
      <para role="Para">Ninety-five percent of Americans report accessing the Internet, “at least occasionally” (Gottfried,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>), often accessing multiple social media platforms. Research shows both positive and negative associations of social media use (Valkenburg et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) although longitudinal data are lacking. Given the prevalence of use, as well as the possible risks and benefits of use, it is important to examine the role of the client’s social media use and the impact it has on mental health problems, such as anxiety. For example, a client with a social anxiety disorder may avoid real-life social interactions<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>interactions</primary>
         </indexterm> by scrolling through social media. Alternatively, lengthy periods of social media scrolling may increase anxiety and depression symptoms. Consistent with the larger interview approach of nonjudgmental and collaborative inquiry, the clinician should seek to understand the context or function of social media use. Clinicians should ask questions to understand the frequency of use, purpose, and function; patterns or times of day; and social and emotional consequences of use. These variables can further be considered across the following domains, as suggested by<indexterm significance="normal">

         Educational and occupational history<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Educational and occupational history</primary>
         </indexterm>are important components of the interview, as they provide information about the potential factors influencing symptoms, behavior, and functional outcomes of the client’s difficulties. Additionally, for clients seeking neuropsychological evaluations, educational performance and academic achievement are necessary components of the assessment process (e. g., establishing premorbid function, for use in testing norms, etc.). For educational history, the clinician should inquire about the highest level of education, academic performance, strengths or difficulties in learning, behavioral problems, and services received, if any. Because additional learning occurs outside the educational environment, clinicians should also inquire about informal learning, such as apprenticeships or vocational training.</para>
      <para role="Para">Obtaining information about a client’s occupational history is useful for differential diagnosis. For example, clients with attentional or interpersonal challenges may endorse frequent job changes, inability to advance, lack of normal promotion, or difficulties holding down a job. Additionally, the types of work a client engaged in may provide information useful for the interview process (e. g., occupations inconsistent with educational achievements). For all work activities endorsed by the client, the clinician should question the nature of employment and exposure to occupational hazards (e. g., toxic chemicals). Periods of unemployment, including activities the client engaged in during that period, should also be explored.</para>

         </indexterm>. However, because participation in the legal and criminal justice system often has long-term physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences, it is important for clinicians to inquire about a client’s criminal or civil legal history. Additionally, knowing a client’s legal history has direct implications for the differential diagnosis process (e. g., higher rates of legal consequences for those with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder; substance use and misuse leading to arrest and incarceration; history of traffic violations in people with cognitive impairment; etc.). In the case of court-mandated evaluations, the clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>clinician</primary>
         </indexterm> will need to understand the client’s legal history and circumstances related to the court mandate to determine whether assessment or treatment is within the scope of practice.</para>
      <para role="Para">Because a client may be hesitant to disclose a history of legal problems or consequences of past aggressive behaviors, the clinician should inquire directly in a manner that does not stigmatize the client’s history, using open-ended questions with specific follow-up as needed (e. g., “Have you ever experienced legal problems?”). As relevant, the clinician should inquire about a history of arrest, convictions, felonies and misdemeanors, and civil action at all stages of life.</para>
      <para role="Para">Not all legal history will be directly related to a client’s behaviors, such as when a client’s parents divorced or for victims of crime. When working with couples and families, it is important to ask about and understand the details<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> of any active divorce proceedings. Court decisions may outline visitation, medical record access, or who can make decisions about medical and mental health care. A client’s history of victimization may have been addressed when assessing trauma history.
