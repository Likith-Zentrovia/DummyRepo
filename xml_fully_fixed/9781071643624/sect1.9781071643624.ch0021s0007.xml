      </indexterm>interview should consider various factors that are critical to making a diagnosis. Most importantly, the interviewer should obtain information about the frequency of the presenting symptoms, their severity, and their duration. When considering each of these three domains, the clinician should also assess the settings in which these symptoms occur and should evaluate whether there are certain settings in which the symptoms present more frequently or severely. To accomplish this, clinicians must be aware of factors such as caregiver-child interactions, structure in the home, and classroom variables (e. g., structure, seat placement), among others. By considering environmental factors that may impact symptom presentation, this would allow for more effective and specific treatment planning.</para>
   <para role="Para">In addition to the child and caregiver perspective about presenting problems, clinicians should also obtain information from other individuals in the child’s life that may have information that would inform<indexterm significance="normal">

When gathering information from various informants, it is important to identify individuals who spend a significant amount of time with the child (e. g., the homeroom teacher who sees the child each day, a caregiver that spends the majority of the time with the child), as these people are likely to provide the most useful information about<indexterm significance="normal">
