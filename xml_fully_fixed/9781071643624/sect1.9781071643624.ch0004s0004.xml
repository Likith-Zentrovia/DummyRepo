      <title>Onset</title>
      <para role="Para">Knowing the onset<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>onset</primary>
         </indexterm>of symptoms is necessary for establishing a timeline. It is also important as age of onset is a diagnostic criterion for some disorders, such as ADHD, which must have symptoms present in childhood. For some problems, clients may be able to tell the clinician precisely when the symptoms or behavior patterns began (e. g., “I started drinking when I was 17 years old”). Other symptoms or behavior patterns may be more difficult to recall precisely, and details of the onset will be vague (e. g., “I have had memory problems for years, but they happened so gradually, I couldn’t say when they began”). Though it may be difficult for a client to recall, the clinician should encourage precision about the onset of symptoms or behaviors. Follow-up questions could include inquiry about precipitating factors to help prompt recall (e. g., “What was going on in your life when the problem began”) or noteworthy dates or events (e. g., “Did you feel this way before or after your last birthday”). The clinician should also ask about whether the problem had an acute or sudden onset versus an insidious or gradual onset<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>onset</primary>
         </indexterm>(e. g., “Did this problem happen suddenly, or did it happen slowly over time”). Problems with an acute onset often occur in response to an external stressor, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, after experiencing a potentially traumatic event. Problems with a gradual onset will often be described as beginning during a specific period (e. g., childhood). When the client presents with multiple problems, the clinician should try to determine which occurred first (e. g., “Which did you notice first, the drinking or the anxiety symptoms”).</para>

      <title>Severity: Frequency, Duration, and Intensity</title>
      <para role="Para">It is sometimes difficult to establish the severity of a client’s problems because the information is subjective. What may be overwhelmingly difficult for one client may be a minor inconvenience for another<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>another</primary>
         </indexterm>. Asking questions that address the frequency, duration, and intensity of symptoms can help determine the subjective severity of symptoms for the client. The clinician may want to ask questions<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>questions</primary>
         </indexterm>about the severity of symptoms on a typical day and compare them with symptoms at the worst level to explore the range of client function. General questions, such as “How often do you experience this symptom” or “How many times did you experience the problem in the last day/week/month” can be useful for establishing frequency. General questions can also be used to inquire about duration, typically by asking how long symptoms last (e. g., when you experience [symptom x], how long does it usually last?). Exploring the duration of symptoms is important for disorders with fluctuating patterns, such as panic or mood swings<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>swings</primary>
         </indexterm>. Simple rating scales can be used to establish the level of symptom intensity (e. g., “On a scale of 0–10 with 0 being nothing and 10 being unbearable, how intense are your symptoms on a typical day,” “What about on your worst days?”).</para>

      <title>Course</title>
      <para role="Para">After discussing the onset and frequency of the presenting problem, the clinician should inquire about the course or progression of symptoms over time. Some clients may have engaged in treatment for the same or similar problems in the past. Others may have been coping with symptoms independently before seeking assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>assessment</primary>
         </indexterm> or treatment. Understanding the course of the problem involves establishing whether previous episodes have occurred, exploring precipitating factors, and evaluating how the problem has changed or progressed over time. After inquiring<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>inquiring</primary>
         </indexterm>if this is the first time the client has experienced these symptoms, the clinician should ask about what was going on in the client’s life when the problem started (if precipitating factors were not covered while discussing the onset). Even if this is the first time the client has experienced the problem, exploring the course and patterns of symptom fluctuation can be useful for ruling in/out disorders (e. g., the timeline for hypomanic versus manic episodes and periods of remission).</para>
      <para role="Para">Periods when a client does not experience symptoms or behavioral problems are just as important as when symptoms are present. Thus, the clinician should ask about periods with symptom relief or remission (e. g., “Are there periods when you do not experience the problem? How much time typically goes by between episodes?”). Understanding the trajectory of symptom change over time and factors that trigger an increase in symptoms is also necessary for diagnosis and treatment planning (e. g., “Has the problem changed over time,” “How has it changed—worse, better, stayed the same<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>same</primary>
         </indexterm>,” “What makes the problem worse for you and what makes it better?”). If a prior episode was reported, the clinician should inquire about how the client coped with the previous episode and how the current episode compares to past episodes.</para>

      <title>Prior Treatment and Attempts to Solve the Problem</title>
      <para role="Para">Assessing the history of a client’s presenting problem also involves inquiries about prior resolution efforts, including previous assessment and psychological or pharmacological treatments. The clinician should inquire about all types of past treatment, including outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department visits for psychiatric issues. The clinician can start this line of inquiry with questions<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>questions</primary>
         </indexterm>exploring the client’s efforts to address the problem, including information about the perceived helpfulness or unhelpfulness of treatment. For all prior treatment episodes endorsed by the client, the clinician should follow up with more in-depth questions about the type of treatment (e. g., psychotherapy, medication, supplements, neurostimulation, self-help groups, etc.), setting (e. g., outpatient, inpatient, emergency room), duration, and doses. Response to treatment should also be assessed, including rapport/alliance with the treating provider, perceived benefits, and side effects. When discussing response to treatment, the clinician should inquire about symptom response and functional outcomes. If a client endorses poor treatment response, the clinician should inquire about reasons, including difficulty developing rapport with the clinician or poor adherence to the treatment protocol. If the client is willing to sign a release of information, the clinician may request records from prior providers<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>providers</primary>
         </indexterm>, including previous intake reports, relevant progress notes, and treatment summaries. Understanding what worked well for the client and what did not will be useful for future treatment planning.</para>

      <title>Stressors: Precipitating Factors and Outcomes of the Problem</title>

            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Stressors include conditions that may impact the frequency, duration, and intensity of the presenting problem<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>problem</primary>
         </indexterm>. They may cause or result from a client’s symptoms or behaviors. Clinicians should inquire about a client’s exposure to current and past adverse experiences and stressors that impact overall well-being. Because a person’s subjective response to a stressor, or stress reactivity, is also associated with mental health (see Rush et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>), clinicians should ask whether clients feel they are coping adequately with stressors. The goal of evaluating stressors and stress reactivity is to explore factors that may directly impact or result from the presenting problem. At a minimum, clinicians should inquire about financial stressors, housing status, educational or occupational problems, interpersonal problems, social support, and strengths (e. g., “What resources do you use when faced with challenges or stressors in your life,” Are there any areas you feel that your resources are lacking, such as finances, time or social support”).</para>

            <primary>strengths</primary>
         </indexterm> allows the clinician to build upon the client’s current foundation of adaptive behaviors, skills, and abilities. Strength-based approaches (see Hass, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
