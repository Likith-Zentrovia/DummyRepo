   <title>Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Psychologists must tune into aspects of diversity during the assessment process and throughout therapy. Identity factors are often social determinants of health, and according to the American Psychological Association (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>), best practices in evidence-based assessment and therapy should incorporate identity. Addressing diversity factors is a critical element in the biopsychosocial approach. Additionally, psychologists must demonstrate cultural humility and competency throughout the patient-therapist relationship. Psychologists follow ethical principles<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>principles</primary>
      </indexterm> and a code of conduct (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Specifically, the principles of justice and respect for people’s rights and dignity encompass our duty to address how our clients’ identities, lived experiences, and overall health factor into the care we provide and how we deliver our care. Exploring diversity factors contributes to obtaining the most comprehensive assessment and optimizes rapport, which we know is the number one predictor of a successful therapeutic outcome (Norcross &amp; Lambert, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Using the case examples from above and integration<indexterm significance="normal">

We also specifically address these factors per the above case vignettes.</para>

      <para role="Para">The importance of assessing age/generation<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>age/generation</primary>
         </indexterm> is underscored when we consider generational influences and how those may impact the patient’s self and worldview. What did they live through politically? Socioeconomically? Scientifically? Social justice movements? Do they hold internalized ageist attitudes?</para>
      <para role="Para">In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June’s, age and generational influences may inform the case given that she is a black woman who lived through the desegregation of schools, which means she likely experienced educational racism, in addition to systemic and overall overt institutional racism. Further, she was also alive during the Tuskegee Syphilis studies from 1932 to 1972, whereby many black individuals’ mistrust of the healthcare system developed and was reinforced. Furthermore, it may have been beneficial to assess for any ageist views that she holds of herself, internalized ageism, such as, “Well, I am getting older and just moved into the old folks’ home, so it may be a lost cause anyways.”</para>
      <para role="Para">Ana, from case example one, is 92 years old. As the daughter of immigrants, she was born during the Great Depression<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> housing, healthcare, and nutrition severely impacted Latinx families, who also faced racism and discrimination. Often, families relied on community support, if available, or were faced to make ends meet. As an infant, Ana’s mortality was in peril due to limitations on nutrition for infants at this time; however, she survived. Considering her development in adolescence and young adulthood, Ana may also have been subject to abandoning her education to find work and financially help the family. Individuals and families faced considerable financial hardships at this time, considering the influence of Ana’s upbringing and her comments regarding frustration in seeing her daughter’s financial<indexterm significance="normal">

         Psychologists<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Psychologists</primary>
         </indexterm>must assess for developmental (e. g., intellectual, autism, cerebral palsy, etc.) and acquired disability (e. g., TBI, amputation, etc.). In the case of Phyllis, she did not have any developmental or acquired disabilities. If she were to have had something, say she utilized a cane to assist in mobility due to her chronic pain, how would this influence her self-esteem and sense of self in general? Would this influence her willingness to go into public, given that this could be considered an overtly obvious disability?</para>
      <para role="Para">The psychologist working with Ana observed her reliance on a mobility assistive device. She used a motorized wheelchair and experienced difficulty transferring. This difficulty with transfer affected her physical comfort and her mental health. Further exploration of comorbid incontinence issues and COPD may also garner insight into<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>into</primary>
         </indexterm>how these issues may be contributing to symptoms of agoraphobia, excoriation, and anxiety. Additionally, Ana reported challenges with medication management, and it is an additional indicated need for support and monitoring. Assessing for potential cognitive decline with a cognitive screener can help tailor interventions to her cognitive strengths and weaknesses. A brief cognitive assessment may also provide insight for the psychologist to consider a referral for comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation if Ana’s symptoms worsen over time. Ana also noted fears about her neighbors and the safety of her apartment. These are significant stressors that exacerbate her mental health symptoms. Limited mobility and fear of leaving her apartment contribute to social isolation, impacting her mental health and overall quality of life. Consulting with social workers may help<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">Partnering with additional specialty professions such as occupational and physical therapy, social work, speech, and audiology, to name a few, is best practice to help bridge the gap between the individual and their ability to continue navigating the world meaningfully. Further work with individuals with developmental and acquired disabilities may also ask us to consider modifying the materials we present to them, such as audio format<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>orientation</primary>
         </indexterm> is a protective factor for patients and a source of strength and resilience to capitalize upon in therapy. Religious and spiritual commitment can vary. Furthermore, some religions may not be open to practicing some third-wave therapeutic strategies, such as mindfulness and meditation. In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June, her Buddhist spirituality may help guide the behaviors she chooses to engage in during treatment. She may also wish to engage in more meditation or mindfulness to facilitate her behavioral activation. Moreover, it is also possible that Phyllis has noticed herself engaging in less spiritual practices; as we know<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>know</primary>
         </indexterm>, at times, patients can withdraw from valued activities when feeling down, which may be an area to target.</para>
      <para role="Para">Ana finds comfort in prayer and meditation, which are integral to her coping strategies and overall well-being. Understanding her spiritual background can help integrate culturally relevant practices into her treatment plan. We could consider the individual’s community involvement and review her participation in spiritual practices within this setting. Alternatively, if the healthcare system offers chaplain<indexterm significance="normal">

         Ethnicity<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Ethnicity</primary>
         </indexterm> may be an overt, observable difference between the individual and the clinician. Exploring ethnic identity could impact trust, rapport, and willingness to open up in the therapeutic context. In the case of Phyllis, if the clinician were of a different ethnicity than her, it would be valuable to acknowledge this openly. For example, stating, “I am not going to pretend I know what it is like to be a black woman living in America. I may bring to our relationship new tools for you to navigate your chronic pain, and you come with your lived experiences, and together, we can co-construct the space between us to facilitate a more meaningful life for you.”</para>
      <para role="Para">In case example one, the psychologist’s chart review revealed Ana’s bilingual background, prompting the language preference inquiry. She preferred to alternate between Spanish and English during sessions, highlighting the importance of cultural sensitivity and linguistic flexibility. In this<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>this</primary>
         </indexterm>case, the psychologist was also bilingual and could continue engaging Ana and establishing treatment. Had the psychologist and Ana been unable to communicate, the psychologist would identify potential referrals that would accommodate Ana’s language abilities by seeking additional community or hospital referrals, utilizing an interpreter service, and consulting with additional professionals to assist in connecting Ana appropriately.</para>
      <para role="Para">The psychologist was partially attuned to understanding Ana’s ethnic background. The psychologist would need<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>need</primary>
         </indexterm> to follow up and ask how Ana identifies ethnically and how this identity may impact her current state. Further exploration ensures our evaluations and treatments’ accuracy, relevance, and fairness. We can see how ethnicity influences the presentation of Ana’s symptoms. For example, considering Ana’s reporting of her relationship with her daughter and her values related to family, we can consider that her expression is culturally rooted rather than pathological. Exploring ethnicity helps avoid misdiagnosis and ensures the psychologist considers cultural variations in the assessment<indexterm significance="normal">

         Socioeconomic status<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Socioeconomic status</primary>
         </indexterm> is multifaceted. On one hand, education and income fall under an individual’s objective socioeconomic status. There is also a person’s subjective or perceived socioeconomic status, which research is finding also plays a significant role in overall well-being (Navarro-Carrillo et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, clinicians must also be mindful of an intersectional perspective, as socioeconomic status and resources can also be influenced by ageism, racism, gender stereotypes, disability, and more. The role of socioeconomic status in resource availability and access to basic needs can impact a patient’s health and priorities in the therapeutic context.</para>
      <para role="Para">In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June, she did not describe financial difficulties during the intake appointment. However, upon further conversation, it became apparent that the assisted living facility is 45 minutes away<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>away</primary>
         </indexterm> from her family, who no longer can visit her as much because the nearby facility was too expensive and did not accept the couple’s long-term care planning health insurance, for which they had spent their adulthood contributing. Consequently, though they had worked hard to plan for these circumstances, not being near her community and family is a significant stressor for her. She had also wished to leave her children more money upon her death. However, the cost of living in the ALF is starting to exhaust some of those funds. Phyllis verbalized resentment about this situation, which decreased her interest in attending ALF events.</para>
      <para role="Para">In case example one, the psychologist gathered chart review data and later observational data regarding Ana’s socioeconomic status.She<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>She</primary>
         </indexterm> lives in a low-income housing complex, which may impact her sense of safety and contribute to stress and anxiety. Additional information gathered from additional home-based team member visits noted limited income and financial support primarily from state-funded resources. This information is vital to understanding how her access to care and financial constraints likely influenced her access to healthcare and support services.

         </indexterm> sexual orientation as a social determinant of health (Andrinopoulos &amp; Hembling, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Many organizations, such as some Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, have begun to ask this question bi-yearly. Psychologists should not assume that something has not changed because the patient has been asked about it previously, or the willingness to disclose has become more open with time. Again, we can underscore the intersectional nature of sexual orientation as it also pertains to age/cohort differences and religion—did the patient live through the HIV crisis? Did they grow up under strict religious pretenses that condemned the LGBTQ community? Were they in the military when individuals were punished for same-sex sexual acts?</para>
      <para role="Para">Clinicians should approach the topic of relationships and sexual orientation with intentional neutrality. For example<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>example</primary>
         </indexterm>, when asking a patient about their relationship status, regardless of gender expression/sex, the clinician can say, “Are you partnered? Do you have more than one partner?” Asking in this manner creates an open and safe dialogue without assumptions regarding the person’s sexuality. You may have had the experience of being at a medical appointment and being asked, if your gender expression is assumed feminine, “Do you have a boyfriend?” or if your gender expression is assumed masculine, “Do you have a wife?” These questions automatically apply assumption and, for some with a marginalized identity, may create discomfort in sharing the identity of their partner(s), and/or mistrust that if they were to share, they may receive less adequate or biased care. Furthermore, a person’s relationship status/partner’s gender does not indicate their sexual orientation. Thus, asking “What is your sexual orientation?” or “How would you describe your sexual orientation?” is essential.</para>
      <para role="Para">In the case of Phyllis, though she is married to a man, it is still important to ask about her sexual orientation. It can be<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>be</primary>
         </indexterm> easy to assume, given her long-time marriage. However, this can also be an avenue for building more rapport, particularly if she does hold a diverse sexual identity, and has been hiding it for most of her life due to stigma growing up in her generation, living through events such as the Stonewall Riots, or Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell—even though they may not have applied to her directly, she was exposed to these movements which may have influenced her willingness to disclose her own identity as a queer black woman.</para>
      <para role="Para">Chart review of case example one noted Ana’s reporting a life-long heterosexual sexual orientation and cisgender female identity. The psychologist introduced themselves and pronouns and offered for Ana to share in return. Sexual orientation was verified and confirmed with Ana. Ana did not elaborate on her past and current romantic relationships but confirmed a traumatic history with male partners. Ana’s confirmation of her trauma history, in part, was a reason for her continued request for a female-only healthcare team. Asking about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) reduces healthcare disparities and<indexterm significance="normal">

Ask a patient, “Are there elements of your culture and heritage that are important to you?” “How does your culture and heritage impact you daily and globally?”</para>
      <para role="Para">As described, Phyllis is currently in an ALF. Though she appreciates the opportunity for her new residence, her resentment, as described in the socioeconomic status section, in conjunction with the lack of community, has decreased behavioral activation. Discussing her Indigenous heritage can help identify non-tangible and tangible elements of her culture. The psychologist can use motivational interviewing through a culturally aware lens to facilitate exploring additional activities and incorporate more movement and engagement in Phyllis’ routine.</para>
      <para role="Para">The psychologist working with Ana is attuned to exploring her cultural background. The psychologist asked Ana about her experiences, values, family dynamics, and spirituality. Although these aspects may not always align with an individual’s cultural identity, the psychologist can promote further insight into her values, experiences, and potential barriers to treatment with further exploration<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>exploration</primary>
         </indexterm> of the individual’s cultural heritage and background. Understanding an individual’s cultural background can inform more personalized and effective treatment plans. For example, considering Ana’s relationship with her daughter, we may ask if she would like to involve her daughter in therapy and treatment planning with her medical team. This option may be an effective intervention for individuals from collectivistic cultures such as Latinx<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">Similarly, Ana was also born in the United States; however, her parents were immigrants to the United States.

Within an intersectional lens, age, race, and religion are compounded by oppressed and marginalized identities and other psychosocial variables. During assessment, a psychologist may ask the patient “How would you describe your gender identity?” In the case of Phyllis, she identifies as a female, and the intersection of this with her identity as a black, older adult woman has likely contributed to the gendered racism and ageism she has felt throughout her life.</para>
