      <para role="Para">Psychoactive substances<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>substances</primary>
         </indexterm>are categorized into specific drug classes (e. g., stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens) that differ in their physiological and behavioral effects and associated risks and consequences. For example, a stimulant versus an opioid analgesic produces very different physiological and psychological effects. Cocaine use<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>use</primary>
         </indexterm> is often associated with feelings of euphoria, increased energy, alertness, and rapid speech, as well as physiological effects such as increased heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure. In contrast, heroin use tends to produce tranquility, sedation, and reduced anxiety; the physical effects may include<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>include</primary>

            <primary>Cocaine</primary>
         </indexterm> is often linked with increases in sexual risk-taking behaviors and an increased likelihood of cocaine-induced psychosis, whereas heroin is associated with intense physical withdrawal symptoms and increased risk of fatal and non-fatal overdose.

         </indexterm>, and psychotic disorders. SUDs also often co-occur with personality disorders such as borderline and antisocial personality disorders (Parmar &amp; Kaloiya, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses often play an influential role in the course of SUD, increasing the likelihood of early treatment termination, return to substance use, and other negative psychosocial consequences (Andersson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Krawczyk et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <primary>co-occurring</primary>
         </indexterm>mental health symptoms in relation to substance use irrespective of a co-occurring diagnosis. Consider a client suffering from elevated depressive symptoms; low mood or hopelessness may be a trigger for their substance use, which can then inform the use of an SUD treatment that addresses depressive symptoms (e. g., behavioral activation for SUD; Daughters et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is helpful to assess common symptoms and underlying psychological and behavioral constructs (e. g., emotion regulation, distress tolerance, impulsivity). The reader is referred to the Science of Behavior Change Measures Repository (Science of Behavior Change, 2017) for tools to assess symptoms in the domains of self-regulation, stress reactivity and stress resilience, and interpersonal and social processes.</para>

      <title>The Role of Stigma in Assessment</title>
      <para role="Para">Substance use problems<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>problems</primary>
         </indexterm> are highly stigmatized, even more than other mental health problems (Barry et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). People who use drugs report stigmatization when accessing medical care and drug treatment, which is related to reduced utilization of these services (Paquette et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In the context of screening and assessment, stigma may contribute to a reluctance to disclose substance use and may lead individuals to minimize their substance-related problems. To maximize the validity of assessments, effective interviewers will emphasize building rapport, discuss substance use in a direct, nonjudgmental manner, and avoid use of potentially stigmatizing language (e. g., “addict,” “junkie,” “alcoholic”). In addition to avoiding slang and idioms, current recommendations for reducing inadvertent stigmatization include using person-first language (e. g., “person with an opioid use disorder”) and language that emphasizes the medical nature of substance use<indexterm significance="normal">
