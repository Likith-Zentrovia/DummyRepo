   <title>Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity on Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">As with any diagnostic interview or clinical encounter, the impacts of various domains of cultural identity must be taken into consideration when conducting an interview with an individual who may have schizophrenia. It is incumbent on the interviewer to develop cultural competence by seeking awareness, knowledge, and skills in order to more fully understand the sociocultural contexts and common cultural concepts of distress (CCD) of the patients they interview.</para>

      </emphasis>). The CFI<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>CFI</primary>
      </indexterm> is a useful aid to assessing cultural factors in the clinical encounter and in communicating with the individual. This 16-question semi-structured interview, administered in as little as 20 min, assesses four domains: (1) cultural definition of the problem, (2) cultural perceptions of cause, context, and support, (3) cultural factors affecting self-coping and past help seeking, and (4) cultural factors affecting current help seeking. Research indicates the CFI promotes communication, rapport, and patient engagement, and individuals with psychotic disorders have specifically reported that the CFI was validating, therapeutic, and led to deeper realizations about themselves and their recovery (Muralidharan et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <primary>non-Western</primary>
         </indexterm> cultures appear to experience hallucinations as less distressing than members of Western societies which, given the diagnostic criterion of functional impairment in schizophrenia, has implications for clinical assessment (Luhrmann et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Related, many religious and cultural communities attribute voice-hearing and/or a perceived connection with higher powers not to mental illness, but to spiritual sources (Larøi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Different religious traditions have divergent beliefs about communication with God, communication with deceased individuals, and the role of God (or gods) in determining one’s path or fate<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>fate</primary>
         </indexterm> in life. Clinicians should keep in mind the ways in which culture may impact perceptual experiences. Indeed, thoughts that are considered unusual in Western cultures may be neither indicative of schizophrenia nor inherently pathological in non-Western cultures, and they must represent functional impairment in the individual’s context. Thus, before concluding that a belief is delusional it is important to gain an understanding of the individual’s<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> diagnosis. Specifically, Black individuals are much more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia than White individuals in the United States (Gara et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to explain this disparity, including the inadequate cultural sensitivity of diagnostic instruments, clinician bias, cultural influences on symptom expression during assessment and learned, potentially adaptive vigilance or “healthy paranoia” related to racial discrimination or other psychosocial stressors associated with dense urban and/or low-income environments (Combs et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In an investigation of clinician bias, Gara et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) used clinical interview transcripts that removed all patient ethnicity cues and compared these diagnosis to original diagnoses made with unredacted transcripts. They found that clinicians failed to complete a thorough assessment of mood symptoms and tended to preemptively give a diagnosis of schizophrenia to Black patients when they reported auditory hallucination symptoms.</para>
      <para role="Para">These diagnostic trends<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>trends</primary>
         </indexterm>are complicated further by the fact that Black individuals may be at greater risk for psychotic disorder, due to greater exposure to risk factors for psychosis, including<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>urban upbringing, low socioeconomic status, social exclusion, and trauma exposure (Selten et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clinicians are therefore encouraged to develop cultural awareness in their assessment skills, carefully assess the range of psychiatric symptoms in patients, and entertain multiple hypotheses about the etiology<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> of symptoms.</para>

      <para role="Para">The onset<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>onset</primary>
         </indexterm> of schizophrenia occurs most often in late adolescence or early adulthood with a slightly older average age of onset for women than for men. Positive symptoms are often most severe during the first few years of the disorder, after which most people experience a stabilization or reduction in symptom levels as they age. Negative symptoms and cognitive impairments do not appear to decline with age or duration of illness. Thus, clinical presentation may vary over time, and the interviewees age and age of illness onset are important considerations.</para>
      <para role="Para">With the realization that earlier intervention leads to better outcomes, there has been an increased focus on screening for psychosis among young people. However, several issues complicate screening in children and<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>and</primary>
         </indexterm> adolescents. First, psychotic symptoms for most youth presenting for evaluation are only just emerging. A longer-term history of symptom course is therefore typically unavailable<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>unavailable</primary>
         </indexterm>to inform the diagnosis. Second, magical thinking, thoughts of being the focus of others’ attention, and other psychosis-like experiences are often part of normative development for children and adolescents. Interviewees may therefore endorse experiences that on their surface appear to implicate a psychotic disorder, but after detailed probing, they are revealed to lack the pathological nature inherent to schizophrenia. For these reasons, parental input is often especially valuable when assessing for schizophrenia among youth.</para>
      <para role="Para">It is important to note that the earliest clinical manifestations of psychosis often involve positive symptoms that are not severe enough to be considered formally psychotic. As symptoms first begin to develop, insight into the nature of the experience often remains intact (e. g., the individual has begun to hear a voice, but recognizes that it is not real) and/or the symptom is not yet seriously impairing. Given their association with a subsequent onset of schizophrenia, the emergence of attenuated<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>attenuated</primary>

         positive<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>positive</primary>
         </indexterm>symptoms among adolescents and young adults (i. e., the peak age of onset for schizophrenia) itself often warrants clinical attention. Notably, however, most individuals with attenuated psychosis do not go on to develop the full disorder (Fusar-Poli et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clinicians are therefore challenged to carefully assess the degree of conviction and impairment stemming from putative psychotic symptoms in young people, maintaining attention to the possibility that they may suggest an emerging disorder, while at the same time not assuming the diagnosis is or ever will be schizophrenia.</para>
      <para role="Para">In summary, we recommend that clinicians not only gather knowledge about cultural identity domains that can overlap with of schizophrenia but also strive to develop awareness of their own biases and develop skills to more carefully ascertain impact<indexterm significance="normal">
