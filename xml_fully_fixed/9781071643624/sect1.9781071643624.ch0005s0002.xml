      <title>General Observations</title>
      <para role="Para">Within the context of a thorough evaluation, the MSE<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MSE</primary>
         </indexterm> offers the clinician a unique opportunity to observe and interpret client behavior and highlight the idiosyncratic characteristics of the person in the room. The general observations of the MSE include a broad range of characteristics that are immediately observable to the clinician. These are described in detail within the MSE to inform our understanding of how the client presents themselves to the world and, reflexively, how they are perceived by others. Features of the client’s appearance and behaviors may fluctuate over the course of the evaluation or remain static—each noteworthy for interpretation. Independently, each of these features, even if unusual or pathological<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>pathological</primary>
         </indexterm>, may be incidental and unworthy of interpretation; however, the combined effect of multiple observations guides the attentive clinician toward a thorough and accurate conceptualization over time.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Arrival</emphasis>: The clinician notes the timing of the client’s arrival (e. g., early, on-time, late) and whether they came to the appointment alone or with a family member, friend, or caregiver. Documenting the method of transportation used to get to the appointment (e. g., personal car, bus, bike) can also be useful for interrogating greater system-level barriers that the client faces and for optimizing scheduling and attendance. Late arrivals may be indicative of disorganization or poor planning, may suggest ambivalence about treatment, or could result from a public transportation delay. If the client is accompanied by a family member or other caregiver, this can offer information about the client’s support system and level of independence in daily functioning. Initial interactions with administrative staff can reflect the client’s ability to navigate large, complex healthcare systems<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>systems</primary>
         </indexterm> and to engage in social interactions with strangers. Familiarity with the setting and location may imply intact recall of prior or related appointments, whereas difficulties with check-in may imply the novelty of the appointment to the client’s typical routine. Details about the client’s attitude toward the session can be observed and inferred from the client’s behavior in the waiting room or lobby prior to the start of the appointment.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Appearance</emphasis>: Describing grooming, dress, and other appearance factors (e. g., body size and stature) can provide rich information, including impressions about overall health and well-being, organization, and awareness of environmental and contextual cues, such as weather and formality of the setting. Descriptions of hygiene and grooming may note appearance of skin, hair, teeth, and clothing, as well as the presence of body odor. Use of visual, hearing, or ambulatory aids should be noted<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>noted</primary>
         </indexterm>. Clinicians may describe whether the person appears younger or older than, or consistent with, their stated age. Each feature of the client’s physical appearance presents an opportunity for the clinician to engage in client-centered questioning that emphasizes the clinician’s attention to and care for the client, facilitating the development of rapport.</para>
      <para role="Para">Beyond health, well-being, and overall attention and care to appearance, these factors can provide possible clues about client income and spending habits as well as their adherence to cultural norms and popular trends. Attention to details of appearance aids the clinician in understanding how this client is likely to be perceived by others. Physical evidence of bodily injuries or scars, particularly those that are recent, contributes to the clinician’s impressions about client health and safety. Injuries can serve as possible indicators of self-harm, abuse, neglect, possible substance misuse<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>misuse</primary>
         </indexterm>, falls, and mobility problems. Notable decline in grooming and hygiene suggests the need to further assess functional impairment. Of note, clinicians should present objective and specific observations in this section using up-to-date language and consider their own biases and cultural assumptions. Judgment of appearance is highly susceptible to culturally shaped ideals. Hair (e. g., locs) and headwear (e. g., Jewish men wearing a kippah or yarmulke, Sikh men and women wearing a turban) are especially related to identity and culture. Although noting body size/stature is common in the MSE, clinicians must take care to avoid anti-fat bias. Clinicians must avoid perpetuating systemic exclusion, structural racism, and implicit bias and use inclusive language when describing individuals (American Psychological Association,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For example, rather than writing that a client “<emphasis>is unattractive and does not take good care of herself</emphasis>,” a more useful description may observe the client was<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>was</primary>
         </indexterm> “<emphasis>disheveled and apparently lacking in grooming and hygiene, presenting to the appointment with stained clothes, food in her teeth, and notable body odor</emphasis>.” It is important to keep in mind that clients typically have the right to access their clinical notes and may read the MSE.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Speech and language</emphasis>: Clinicians must assess the nature and quality of a client’s spontaneous speech, which may reveal unique aspects of a client’s psychological and cognitive functioning. Speech <emphasis>content</emphasis> reflects underlying thought processes and is analyzed in the below section on Thinking. In contrast, speech <emphasis>quality</emphasis> is evaluated based on rate, tone, volume, and prosody. Speech <emphasis>rate</emphasis>indicates response speed (i. e., absent, slow, normal, fast, pressured). Speech<emphasis>tone</emphasis> can be static or variable. A <emphasis>monotone</emphasis> client has an unchanging vocal expression regardless of emotion or content, while a <emphasis>variable</emphasis> tone, within normal limits, reflects culturally typical voice inflection, indicating mood, affect, and emotional connection to the content. <emphasis>Volume</emphasis> measures the loudness of speech<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>speech</primary>
         </indexterm> relative to situational appropriateness. Hypophonia<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Hypophonia</primary>
         </indexterm>, defined as soft speech often seen in neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease, may result from vocal muscle coordination issues. <emphasis>Prosody</emphasis> encompasses rhythm and articulation, and it may reflect latency between thoughts. These features collectively indicate language fluency and ease for the client. Other features of speech should also be considered, including the client’s average length of utterance, the syntactical structure, grammatical accuracy, choice of vocabulary, and presence of any regional accents. Such features may imply a level of knowledge and familiarity with the language itself, which would be expected to vary for a native speaker compared to a client for whom English is a second language.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Behavior and psychomotor activity</emphasis>: Observing client behavior and psychomotor activity during the interview provides insights into symptom presence and frequency. Clinicians should note subtle abnormalities<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>abnormalities</primary>
         </indexterm>, such as excessive or absent movement (<emphasis>positive and negative symptoms</emphasis>), which may indicate neurological issues or movement disorders. In the absence of such a contribution, such excessive, slowed, or absent movements may indicate psychotic features, substance influence, major depressive disorder, or discomfort, such as anxiety or guardedness. Clients with <emphasis>trichotillomania</emphasis> (hair pulling) or similar bodily-focused behaviors may exhibit these patterns to relieve tension or distress. It is crucial to observe any mismatch between a client’s outward state and their expressed thoughts and emotions. Clients may deny psychological distress verbally but exhibit behaviors suggesting underlying distress. Note eye contact, mannerisms, and overall posture during the interview, which reflect the client’s internal state and comfort level with the therapist. Details like pupil size indicate engagement, interest, or potential substance use or psychosis. For example, a depressed client may slouch and avoid eye contact, while a guarded client may cross their arms, and an anxious client may display nervous habits like hair twirling. Each of these behaviors contributes to the clinician’s impression.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         Psychomotor activity<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Psychomotor activity</primary>
         </indexterm> also encompasses formal assessment of neurological symptoms like gait and motor abnormalities. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with common motor symptoms in various neurological conditions. For instance, Parkinson’s disease often shows resting tremor, stiffness, <emphasis>bradykinesia</emphasis> (slowness of movement), <emphasis>akinesia</emphasis> (reduced voluntary movement), and abnormal gait (short strides with postural abnormalities; Thenganatt &amp; Louis, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Huntington’s disease features <emphasis>chorea</emphasis> (full-body jerking movement), while advanced dementias or encephalopathy may cause a wide-based, unsteady, or shuffling (train track) gait. Multiple sclerosis may involve muscle weakness and <emphasis>paresthesia</emphasis> (numbness and tingling), and strokes can lead to persistent motor deficits like <emphasis>hemiparesis</emphasis> (one-sided weakness). Observation provides insight and signals the use of formal testing to help diagnose and assess severity.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Manner of relating and attitude toward the examiner</emphasis>: The clinician summarizes the client’s relational manner, capturing how they present and express themselves. This observation includes the client’s interpersonal style and perception of the interview setting, providing indicators of their attitude. Receptiveness to treatment is assessed through their overall behavior and responses.</para>
      <para role="Para">Clients’ relational styles vary and can be gleaned from observations of behavior, speech, and content. Assessment includes eye contact, motor behavior, emotional transparency, and compliance. A client’s relational style can range from hostile, aggressive, guarded, cooperative, pleasant, to passive. Different psychiatric disorders are associated with distinct patterns of comportment. For example, the client with schizophrenia may be most likely to regard the clinician with suspicion; the client with borderline personality disorder may fluctuate between excessive admiration for and dissatisfaction with the clinician at different points in time; and the client with depression may be cooperative and compliant, but passive.</para>

            <emphasis>Ms. Martin is a 71-year-old white woman presenting for initial evaluation in the context of persistent symptoms of depression, following her recent diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. She arrived for her appointment on time and was unaccompanied. She ambulated with the assistance of a rolling walker; her gait was slow with shallow steps. She exhibited fluctuating dyskinesia of the head, neck, and trunk throughout the day, which worsened with increasing time since her medication dose. Oral comprehension was intact as evidenced by Ms. Martin’s responses to interview questions. Her spontaneous speech was fluent and prosodic but slowed and hypophonic with mildly decreased articulation. Ms. Martin was friendly and cooperative and remained engaged with the clinician throughout the interview.</emphasis>

      <title>Thinking</title>
      <para role="Para">It can be challenging to accurately assess client thinking, given the internal nature of this domain, which may include the client’s inner dialogue. As a result, much of this information is gleaned through observation of the client throughout the interview. Nonetheless, clinicians must also directly assess the presence of perceptual disturbances (e. g., hallucinations) and risk of harm. Assessment of thought is paramount for detecting and differentiating certain psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Clients without psychopathology, as well as those with otherwise significant psychological problems (e. g., anxiety or depressive disorders), are often able to express themselves in an organized and realistic fashion. Disturbances in thinking should raise suspicion of a psychotic disorder but may also suggest a severe depressive episode, mania, substance use/misuse, or other disorders affecting cognition including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<indexterm significance="normal">

Termed<emphasis>bradyphrenia</emphasis>, this slowness of thought is characteristic of developmental disabilities such as intellectual developmental disorder, psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and can be a side effect of some antipsychotic medications. The mental fog of severe depression may also produce slowed thought, and some clients with this experience indicate that friends or family members have noticed the problem. Medical conditions can also alter mental status, including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), delirium, and acute substance intoxication. For example, hypoglycemia may present as sudden confusion, and delirium can present with perceptual distortions but also confusion, disorientation, and general fluctuations in consciousness.</para>
      <para role="Para">The flow of thought refers to how thoughts are connected and may be described somewhere along the continuum from goal-directed to incoherent or disorganized.

A client with poverty of thought will respond to questions with the minimum number of words required and offer very little of the spontaneous speech typical of normal thought processes. The clinician will find himself asking more questions than usual because the client offers little elaboration. Asking open-ended questions is an effective way to elicit a flow of spontaneous speech, preventing a simple yes or no answer. Importantly, the clinician must assess whether this type of client is evidencing poverty of thought (a symptom of a psychotic or thought disorder) or presenting as guarded or hostile. A related term is <emphasis>alogia</emphasis>, which is a lack of speech caused by impaired thought process. This extreme example of thought poverty is a common negative symptom of schizophrenia.</para>

         <emphasis role="strong">Suicidal and homicidal ideation</emphasis>: Assessment of suicidality and homicidality is a unique and essential aspect of client thought content that deserves special attention by the clinician. Such assessment is crucial in every clinical interview as it represents one of the major areas of risk for clients in mental health settings (not to mention clinician liability). It is routinely documented in the MSE, whether present or absent. Clinicians should ascertain the nature of a client’s suicidality, whether it be <emphasis>passive ideation</emphasis>, such as a desire to “not wake up,” versus an intention to actively end one’s life (often referred to as <emphasis>active ideation</emphasis>). Whether or not a client endorses current suicidality, it is important to assess prior history of suicidal attempts and self-harm. Recent serious attempts, such as those with lethal risk and/or the provision of rapid and effective emergency response, imply greater risk and greater need for focused attention (Jobes, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>) is commonly administered to assess for the presence of suicidal ideation; item 9 asks about the presence and frequency of thoughts that “life is not worth living, or that you’d be better off dead?”. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

In this section, we discuss the observation and assessment of cognitive variables without the use of standardized tests.

For the cognitively normal client, the quick and familiar “alert and oriented x 4” classification is a necessary snapshot of client presentation that is meaningful across healthcare disciplines. Common variations of this include clients who may be largely oriented, but without the ability to specify details about time or place, as with those experiencing dementia. Others may report correct orientation to place and time but may falter in their description of a session’s situation or precipitating purpose.<emphasis>Level of consciousness</emphasis>is typically summarized by a single word, indicating the extent of alertness and ability to respond to questions (e. g., alert and responsive, awake, asleep, lethargic).

         </indexterm>or even over the course of a hospital stay, particularly in inpatient settings (e. g., secondary to delirium or medication side effects) or in specific populations (e. g., in someone with dementia with Lewy Bodies). In such cases, cognitive fluctuations should be noted and described over time. It may be necessary to ascertain details of orientation through direct questioning, such as asking clients to provide the date (including day, month, and year), the name of the place in which they are being seen, and the reason for their visit. Asking the client for relevant details about the broader context of time may be useful for assessing their connection to aspects of current culture and community (e. g., “Who is the president right now<emphasis>?</emphasis>” or “Tell me about a recent story in the news.”).</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Intellectual functioning</emphasis>: Clinicians use the MSE to provide gross estimates about the level and range of cognitive abilities possessed by the client. While multiple theories and constructs of intelligence have been proposed and supported, for our purposes, we will consider intellectual functioning to be a summary description<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>description</primary>
         </indexterm>of premorbid or current abilities that include fact-based, semantic knowledge (i. e., crystallized intelligence) as well as flexible and creative problem-solving skills (i. e., fluid intelligence). These aspects of intelligence can be informally assessed through observation of language and vocabulary use, thought content, and general fund of knowledge, as demonstrated by references in conversational speech. Much can also be gleaned by inquiring about the client’s exposure and access to formal education, the quality of that education, and the client’s ability to excel in those environments. In the absence of formal assessment measures, statements about intellectual functioning should be phrased tentatively and should indicate estimated levels or ranges of functioning only (e. g., “The client appears to be within the expected range of intellectual functioning, consistent with their educational and occupational attainment<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>attainment</primary>
         </indexterm>, with no evidence of intellectual disability or cognitive deficit.”). Avoid using standardized qualitative descriptors of functioning typically associated with formal cognitive or neuropsychological testing, such as <emphasis>impaired</emphasis>, <emphasis>average</emphasis>, or <emphasis>superior</emphasis>, which may mislead the reader about the extent of assessment in this portion of the MSE.</para>
      <para role="Para">Useful questions for assessing intelligence include, “How far did you get in school?”; “What kinds of grades did you get?”; and “What was your favorite (or least favorite) course in school?”. When working with immigrant populations, clinicians should consider differences in how education is structured and ask how school performance was measured. Furthermore, as many intelligence tests use normative groups whose first (and often only) language is English, clinicians should ask what language(s) are spoken by the client, particularly at home, and what they consider their primary or native language.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         <emphasis role="strong">Adaptive and social functioning</emphasis>: For certain client populations and referral questions, it may be critically important to assess both the client’s adaptive functioning, their ability to independently function in everyday<indexterm significance="normal">

Assessing a client’s adaptive and social functioning helps the clinician understand how the client functions in the world and what external supports or skills training they may need as part of treatment. In the context of a brief MSE, the clinician can ask about the client’s ability to independently perform <emphasis>activities of daily living</emphasis>

            <primary>task</primary>
         </indexterm>. The client’s responses are then evaluated to ensure that the client understands all relevant safety concerns and social demands.

Some example questions include, “If you saw a customer in line at the register drop a hundred-dollar bill from their pocket, what would you do?”; “Why is it important to take your medication as prescribed?”; and “If you were home alone and heard a knock on the door at night, but weren’t expecting any guests, what would you do?”</para>

The client’s overall attentional capacity and ability to work with information in immediate consciousness can be assessed through serial subtractions (i. e., serial sevens, or counting down from 100 by seven), recitation of alternating number-letter sequences (i. e., oral Trail Making Test), or by asking the client to spell W-O-R-L-D backward. Forward and backward digit span sequencing is also an efficient and meaningful assessment of immediate attention and working memory capacity.</para>

         <emphasis role="strong">Memory</emphasis>: Assessing a client’s memory can be challenging without standardized assessment. Frequently, the client will serve as the sole historian during the clinical interview, making it challenging for the clinician to verify details of remote or autobiographical memory. If reliability is in question, obtaining consent to speak with a collateral informant and accessing past records is advisable. Memory assessment should cover remote, short- and long-term, and prospective memory<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>Confabulation</primary>
         </indexterm>, where clients provide inaccurate but plausible information due to memory difficulties, can occur. Clinicians can verify remote memory by asking for objective facts or events confirmable through public domain or additional sources. For example, clients can be asked to recite recent US presidents to assess remote memory, though cultural considerations should be noted (e. g., a recent immigrant may not be aware of the previous U. S. presidents). Tailoring questions to the client’s interests, such as sports (e. g., team roster, game outcome), can provide verifiable information for confirmation of remote memory. To assess a client’s short- and long-term memory, the clinician may ask the client to repeat several words immediately after hearing them. Asking for the same words 30 s to 3 min later can provide a quick measure of<emphasis>immediate memory</emphasis>. If the clinician inserts a longer delay period, up to 30 min, the clinician can later ask the client to repeat these words as a measure of <emphasis>long-term storage and retrieval</emphasis>. More nuanced measures of information encoding and retrieval can be assessed through a series of increasingly more assistive steps. A category cue can be provided to the client to help elicit recall of those words not spontaneously produced (e. g., “One of the words on the list was a type of fruit.”). If additional structure is needed to facilitate recall, a set of three, multiple-choice options can be presented. Many of these brief assessment methods are embedded within formal assessments of cognition and mental status such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>). <emphasis>Prospective memory</emphasis>refers to the recall of future events and is crucial for daily tasks like attending appointments and taking medication.

Some clients with normal, or even superior, cognitive abilities will display difficulty with reliability, insight, and judgment because of their psychiatric disorder. Thus, it is important for clinicians to comment on these factors in the MSE.</para>

            <primary>reliability</primary>
         </indexterm>of information presented during the MSE. Though reliability and honesty of the client cannot be directly measured through interview alone, certain behaviors from the client can signal the need for cautious interpretation. For example, clients may exaggerate or over endorse symptoms, resulting in inconsistent or atypical depictions of common disorders. On rare occasions, clients may present a history or list of symptoms that appears to be rehearsed. Clients who are emotionally tied to receiving a specific outcome or diagnosis from the clinician, as in cases where secondary gain is possible, may be particularly well-practiced in providing the diagnostic criteria for a given condition. Formal research has suggested that even certain aspects of client appearance and presentation may suggest unreliability (e. g., the “sunglasses sign;” Bengtzen et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <primary>management</primary>
         </indexterm> is particularly important will present unique challenges for gathering and interpreting reliable information. In cases where reliability appears limited, additional sources of information can be sought following the MSE. A clinician may request permission to contact collateral informants and/or conduct objective personality and cognitive assessment, including measures of symptom validity and client effort.</para>

The determination<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>determination</primary>

Examples of strengths include resilience, persistence, sense of humor, strong social support, engagement in care (e. g., showing up to appointments), and so forth.
