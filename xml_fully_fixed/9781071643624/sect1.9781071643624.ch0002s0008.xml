   <para role="Para">The ability to conduct an efficient and effective clinical and diagnostic interview is arguably one of the most valued skills among mental health professionals<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>mental health professionals</primary>
      </indexterm>. It is during the interview that the clinician learns about the difficulties and challenges experienced by the client and begins to form the foundations of a healing professional therapeutic relationship. Although the metaphor is not a novel one, the job of the interviewer may be likened to that of a detective trying to gather clues to “solve the mystery,” in this example, elucidating the presenting<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>presenting</primary>
      </indexterm> problem and formal diagnosis of the client. The most important aspect of this detective metaphor is that effective interviewers (detectives) are served well by their natural curiosity (truly wanting to understand all aspects of the client’s experiences, no matter how painful or uncomfortable) and the thoughtfulness of their approach (being guided by strategies and principles for gathering data while also forming a positive emotional connection with the client).</para>
   <para role="Para">Broadly construed, the clinical interview is the foundation of all clinical activity in counseling and psychotherapy (Hook et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2010</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Segal et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2008</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Indeed<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Indeed</primary>
      </indexterm>, one cannot be a good clinician without well-developed interviewing skills. Although specific attention is often paid to the initial clinical interview (or first contact between clinician and client), it is ill-advised to think that clinicians first <emphasis>complete</emphasis> an interview and <emphasis>then</emphasis> start treatment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>treatment</primary>
      </indexterm>. Rather, it is more accurate to view the clinical interview as an <emphasis>ongoing</emphasis> part of the overall psychotherapeutic process, and it should be therapeutic in its own right.</para>
   <para role="Para">For many beginning clinicians, trying to manage the content and process of the interview often seems like a daunting task, one that often evokes considerable anxiety. However, with guidance, feedback-informed practice, and a good deal of self-reflection on one’s clinical strengths and still-developing skills, many beginning clinicians find that they are able to refine their interviewing skills over time and become much more comfortable with the process. Indeed, when successfully mastered, clinical and diagnostic interviewing skills become a key component of the clinicians’ repertoire. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss and elucidate some of the key factors that facilitate the interview process. The overview presented in this chapter regarding basic issues in clinical interviewing will also set the stage for the following chapters in this text that provide considerable depth in the major areas of clinical and diagnostic interviewing, including many disorder-specific and population-specific approaches. We begin with discussions of the different settings in which interviews occur,confidentiality<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>confidentiality</primary>
      </indexterm>, common factors, and the basic skills used in interviews. Next, we describe the importance of understanding the impact of client diversity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>diversity</primary>
      </indexterm> on the interview process followed by an explication of the key issues faced by mental health professionals<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>mental health professionals</primary>
      </indexterm> who are in the beginning stages of professional development as a clinician and interviewer. We conclude this chapter with a discussion of some very practical dos and don’ts of clinical and diagnostic interviewing.</para>
