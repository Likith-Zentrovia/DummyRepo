   <title>Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</title>
   <para role="Para">At a minimum, the clinical and diagnostic interview needs to collect information about the nature of the fear response, the boundaries of the controlling stimuli, and escape and avoidance behavior. Evidence from multiple methods is desirable. Regarding the fear response, the presence versus absence of panic attacks, both limited and full, should be determined, as well as the acuity and chronicity of the fear and/or anxiety. Regarding controlling stimuli, boundaries of the controlling stimuli should be determined by self-report and other methods (direct observation, informant report,information<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>information</primary>
      </indexterm> from referring source, self-monitoring, etc.) when possible. Regarding escape and avoidance behavior, reducing threat and/or anxiety should be the implicit motivation (or function) of the behavior. Clinically significant distress or dysfunction should be documented. As with all diagnostic interviews, differential diagnoses must be considered. The anxiety and avoidance must not be due only to the effects of medications or substances, or to medical illness, and should not be better explained by another mental disorder.</para>
