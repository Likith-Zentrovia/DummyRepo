Therefore, it is crucially important that diagnostic information, if accessible, is gained from medical files and other healthcare providers of a patient in addition to a clinical interview and other procedures of gaining diagnostic information. This information impacts different stages of the diagnostic and treatment process. For example, it makes a difference to plan a psychological treatment for individuals whose symptoms are explained by an identifiable medical diagnosis compared to individuals who present with symptoms that currently cannot be medically explained (e. g., supporting the individual in accepting to have<indexterm significance="normal">

               <primary>interviews</primary>
            </indexterm>, using self-report or clinician-rated scales to assess the symptoms and associated cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features of SSRD is recommended. Moreover, validated scales exist to gain the following additional information that can support the diagnostic process: (a) impact of somatic symptoms on individuals’ physical, social and emotional functioning in their daily life, (b) ways of coping with somatic symptoms, (c) perceived self-efficacy and locus of control, and (d) symptom perceptions (e. g., individuals’ expectations about course and timeline of symptoms).</para>

            </indexterm>assessment of somatic symptoms is common. Prospective measures, such as symptom diaries, can help individuals to provide a more accurate symptom report. They support the diagnostic process, help with planning the treatment for an individual, and can be used to monitor changes in symptoms during the course of the treatment as well. Some patients might be worried that their symptoms could deteriorate through paying more attention to them and are hesitant to complete a diary. These worries should be validated and the benefits of using a diary emphasized. Individuals should be invited to complete a diary only for a limited period of time (e. g., a week during the diagnostic phase and another week at the end of the treatment).</para>

            </indexterm> from patients’ environment to gain diagnostic information is important for several different reasons. First, as mentioned earlier, the retrospective memory of somatic symptoms and their course can be inaccurate or biased. Therefore, family members and friends of the patients and their observations of the patient’s symptoms in daily life can add important information to the diagnostic process. Second, living with persistent somatic symptoms has an impact on an individual’s social life. It is not uncommon that<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>that</primary>
            </indexterm>patients with SSRD feel disrespected and misunderstood by their social system. Associated with problematic and less supportive social interactions, these patients report decreased self-confidence, avoidant coping behaviors, increased stress, and problematic symptom appraisals. Learning about problems in social interaction both from individuals with SSRD themselves as well as<indexterm significance="normal">

            </indexterm>are a central part of diagnosing certain SSRD. For example, in individuals with FNSD with motor symptoms, the clinician will have to observe the intensity and quality of the symptoms. Illness behaviors, which are central features of several of the SSRD, can be very subtle, highly automated, and difficult for patients to describe (e. g., body scanning, avoidance behavior). Behavioral observation is needed to identify these behaviors (Oliveira et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

               <primary>mentioned</primary>
            </indexterm> earlier, gaining information from other healthcare providers plays a central role in the diagnostic process of SSRD. Assuming the patient provides consent, healthcare providers should be contacted, updated about the diagnostic outcome, and a collaborative relationship should be established. If physicians who are involved in the patient’s treatment made a medical diagnosis, it is recommended to gain information about this condition. Being informed when starting the diagnostic process helps patients to feel understood and taken seriously and helps the interviewer to add relevant questions.</para>

         <title>Patients with a Biomedical Symptom Model</title>
         <para role="Para">Many patients with SSRD<indexterm significance="normal">
               <primary>SSRD</primary>
            </indexterm> struggle with understanding why they are seen by healthcare providers other than physicians. Patients often experience their symptom(s) of primarily somatic but not psychological nature. Being sent to a psychologist or psychiatrist, or statements such as “your symptoms are caused in your brain” can be extremely confusing and can cause patients to feel dismissed or stigmatized as somebody who makes up symptoms. Part of the diagnostic process is therefore to explore how much the patient has already adopted a biopsychosocial than solely biomedical understanding of their symptoms.</para>

            </indexterm>has been demonstrated to be associated with an inability to rate symptom intensity with numerical rating scales. Patients who are unable to complete traditional self-report scales may be able to complete verbal pain rating scales that use simple phrases to describe different intensities of a symptom. When communication is impossible or the self-report is discordant, clinicians can resort to observational/behavioral symptom scales. Especially for pain symptoms, several scales have been developed and validated, e. g., the Chronic Pain Scale for Nonverbal Adults with Intellectual Disability (CPS-NAID; Burkitt et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
