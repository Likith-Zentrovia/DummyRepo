   <title>Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Given that SSRD had not been introduced before 2013 with the publication of the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>

      <para role="Para">Women tend<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> to report somatic symptoms more commonly than men, an outcome that has been demonstrated across numerous studies of samples with less severe symptoms (Hiller et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>) as well as clinically relevant syndromes of SSD (Jacobi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2004</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It seems however that gender-related distribution of symptom report is also influenced by cultural factors. A study by Piccinelli and Simon (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1997</phrase>
         </emphasis>) showed that the higher prevalence in women is especially common in Western societies. Women also present more frequently with FNSD compared to men (60–75%) (Espay et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Regarding FD, the prevalence is as twice as high for women compared to men, and regarding FD by Proxy, most of the abusers are female and the victim’s mother (Yates &amp; Bass, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). IAD on the contrary seems to be relatively evenly distributed between men and women (Scarella et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>); however, it is unclear how much these symptoms are explained by nonspecific age-related degeneration. Interestingly, syndromes of multiple persistent somatic symptoms seem to be more common in younger age groups, between 18 and 34 years (Leiknes et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>). There have not been differences between IAD patients and the general population in terms of age (Scarella et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). FNSD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>FNSD</primary>
         </indexterm> can occur across the lifespan (Feinstein, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The onset of nonepileptic seizures peaks in the third decade, and functional motor symptoms have their peak onset in the fourth decade (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Across different medical specialties and presentations, individuals who are affected by FD are usually younger, peak prevalence in the middle of their 30s (Hausteiner-Wiehle &amp; Hungerer, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Yates &amp; Feldman, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Regarding FD by Proxy, the vast majority of victims are younger than 5<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> study conducted by the World Health Organization (Üstun &amp; Sartorius, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>), approximately 5500 patients in primary care practices across 15 different study centers were examined in southern and western European countries, Africa, Asia, the USA, and South America. Syndromes of SSD were increased in South American centers. The Epidemiological Catchment Area Study (Robins &amp; Regier, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1991</phrase>
         </emphasis>) in the USA revealed increased prevalence rates of syndromes of multiple persistent somatic symptoms in Black women and men. In a study in British primary care practices, individuals with a European background showed significant lower prevalence rates of somatic symptom report compared to individuals with an Asian background (Farooq et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, these studies are dated from the 1990s and their results are outdated, thus they should be interpreted carefully. Studies demonstrated no differences between patients with IAD and the general population<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">Studies on transcultural<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>differences show that reporting persistent somatic symptoms and associated distress is a common phenomenon worldwide (e. g., Üstun &amp; Sartorius,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1995</phrase>
         </emphasis>). One huge problem is that studies examining transcultural differences in SSRD and somatic symptom report use scales that have mainly been developed in Western countries and are not sensitive toward culturally specific symptoms. Somatic symptoms are, however, prominent in so-called “<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>cultural concepts of distress</primary>
         </indexterm>,” defined as “ways that cultural groups experience<indexterm significance="normal">

            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>, p. 871). An example is Ataque de nervios, a syndrome in individuals of Latin descent, which includes intense emotional upset and various somatic symptoms such as trembling, heat in the chest, or seizure-like episodes. The DSM-5-TR provides a glossary of nine cultural concepts of distress. We strongly recommend to additionally apply the Cultural Formulation Interview (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) in a diagnostic process to assess SSDR in individuals with a cultural background different<indexterm significance="normal">

A high-quality epidemiological study conducted in Germany demonstrated that the highest prevalence rates of somatoform disorders occurred in individuals of the lowest socioeconomic level and those who are unemployed, divorced, widowed, or live in separation (Jacobi et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
