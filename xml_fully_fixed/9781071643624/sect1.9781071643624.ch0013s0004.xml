   <title>Impact of Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Diversity, as it relates to development and expression of dissociative symptoms, has been under-researched (Dorahy et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Although research often focuses on the interaction of a single diversity variable (e. g., culture), human identity is an interactive matrix that frequently shifts with context (Collin &amp; Bilge,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Various identity variables that involve being in a persistent state of disempowerment (e. g., young age, BIPOC) can increase the likelihood of experiencing trauma, and therefore, dissociative symptoms (see Brown,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2008</phrase>
      </emphasis> for a review). Cultural factors<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Cultural factors</primary>
      </indexterm> may also influence the development and expression of dissociative symptoms (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). For example, those in certain cultures may be more likely to describe passive influence phenomena as experiences of possession. Further, it is critical to consider how the clinician’s identity, particularly if they are of the dominant culture, may impact assessment, particularly when working with someone who has multiple target group identities (e. g., a Caucasian heterosexual male evaluating a lesbian African American Woman).</para>

      <title>Intersubjectivity in Diagnostic Interviewing</title>
      <para role="Para">It is imperative<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>imperative</primary>
         </indexterm>to consider the mutual influence of the client and clinician on the diagnostic process. Intersubjectivity is the product of interaction between client and clinician’s identity dimensions. Through this interaction, certain dimensions may be noticeable, while others may be less obvious. Therefore, it is crucial not only to assess and be willing to discuss the client’s identity aspects, as well as the assessor’s own identity and how they may impact what clients share or do not share during evaluation (Petty John et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Among those living with DDs, and particularly DID, intersubjectivity may be even more complex, with the individual potentially experiencing themselves as having multiple and varied self-states. These self-states may identify with varying ages, genders, sexual orientations, ethnicities, and so on. The client’s identity may shift in accordance with dissociative switching so that at one moment, they experience themselves as a cisgendered adult who is a married, heterosexual, Latina woman and the next they experience themselves as a genderqueer Latino<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm>child. In response, it is common for the clinician to experience a pull to shift their own behavior, although it is important to strive to remain as consistent as possible. For example, the clinician may feel a pull to speak in a more simplified manner or in higher-pitched tones commonly used with children. Given the potentially complex and shifting identities of clinicians and DD clients, we recommend that the clinician track the following when interviewing: (1) how the client is experiencing themselves in this moment, (2) precipitants to felt identity shifts (e. g., sounds, topics of conversation, changes in the clinician), and (3) how the clinician is experiencing themselves<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>themselves</primary>
         </indexterm> in relation to the client. When a shift is felt, we invite the clinician to note the same, hold the space for curiosity, and promote exploration. In maintaining this frame throughout the interview, trauma-related triggers and dissociative phenomena can be more readily identified and understood<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">Within the<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>the</primary>
         </indexterm>context of a dominant culture, there are target groups who are disempowered based on an identity variable. Some of those identities change over time, such as age, while others are static (e. g., ethnicity). Whether dynamic or static, certain aspects of identity increase the likelihood of experiencing a traumatic event(s) and developing dissociative symptoms. For example, gay and lesbian individuals are likely to experience attachment-related and other traumas throughout their lives because of their sexuality<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>sexuality</primary>
         </indexterm>, particularly in countries where these aspects of their identity are considered criminal. However, it is also important to note that recent meta-analytic results that suggest childhood maltreatment (e. g., physical, sexual, or emotional abuse), one of the most robust predictors of developing a DD, may be prevalent to a similar degree across the globe (Stoltenborgh et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Research from around the world has demonstrated DDs are common across cultures, suggesting young age may be one of the more important<indexterm significance="normal">
