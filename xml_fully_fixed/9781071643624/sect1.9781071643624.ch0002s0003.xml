      <title>Establishing a Therapeutic Alliance</title>
      <para role="Para">According to the common factors approach, psychotherapy is a socially constructed and mediated healing practice (Laska et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It follows that the relationship between the clinician and client, called the therapeutic alliance, is the most highly researched and perhaps most critical common factor. The therapeutic alliance is characterized by an emotionally charged bond between the therapist and the client and a mutual agreement about the goals and tasks of psychotherapy (Laska et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Establishing a positive working alliance is easier said than done, but establishing a bond with the client is an important requisite for effective interviewing and ongoing psychotherapy<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>psychotherapy</primary>
         </indexterm>, so it should be at the top of your priority list. Indeed, research has consistently identified that cultivation of a positive therapeutic relationship is essential to the success experienced by most clients (see thorough review by Norcross &amp; Lambert, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">At the most basic level, for clients to participate effectively in psychotherapy, it is vital that they feel at ease with the clinician, which facilitates the clients in disclosing and discussing intimate and personal details of their lives. Remember that, initially, many clients do not know what to expect from psychotherapy or from the clinician. Clients are faced with the task of being expected to reveal private and emotionally sensitive information to a veritable stranger. As such, they may be apprehensive, embarrassed, or downright terrified at the beginning of the first interview. Some clients find it difficult to ask for help because of the stigma associated with mental disorders and their treatment. Others may have been in psychotherapy before but did not find it useful, and therefore, they are cautious and skeptical of what the clinician can offer. Table 1.3</para>

      <title>Demonstrating Empathy</title>
      <para role="Para">A key factor in establishing a strong therapeutic alliance<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>alliance</primary>
         </indexterm> and a fundamental skill for any clinician is the ability to empathize with another person’s experiences and convey such empathy through validation and understanding. Empathy is the ability to perceive and understand a client’s feelings “as if” the clinician was experiencing them and to communicate that accurate understanding to the client (Faust, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Always keep in mind that no two clients are the same and the clinician should be attuned to the subtleties of the client’s thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and lived experiences. A distinction to be made is that empathy is understanding, not sympathy. By responding empathically, the client knows that the clinician is accepting<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>accepting</primary>
         </indexterm>, understanding, and joining his or her “world” without judgment, rather than just “feeling bad” for the client (Johnston et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This empathic understanding enhances trust and increases the likelihood that the client will reveal intimate details of his or her life, possibly details that the client has never previously revealed to anyone.</para>
      <para role="Para">Empathy can be conveyed in many ways (e. g., nonverbal behaviors, such as listening attentively, nodding, showing a concerned facial expression; verbal communications of understanding and support) allowing the clinician to choose a style that is most comfortable for him or her. Other important strategies for conveying empathy and validation include an appropriate tone of voice, time and rate of comments and questions, and the area of questioning. When used correctly, these strategies can be critical in conveying warmth and understanding.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0003s03" role="Heading">
      <title>Positive Regard/Affirmation</title>
      <para role="Para">A similar skill to demonstrating empathy, and one that is arguably just as valuable in psychotherapy, is the psychotherapist’s ability to act in an accepting and affirming manner with their clients. Being kind and caring toward clients not only acts as positive reinforcement for their participation in treatment but also affirms their sense of worth (Farber &amp; Doolin,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therapists can convey positive regard for their clients by commending them for attending their appointments and reaching goals or milestones, such as disclosing sensitive information that may have been difficult for the client to talk about. Demonstrating positive regard toward clients facilitates their innate tendency to grow and fulfill their capacity as human beings (Farber &amp; Doolin, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0003s04" role="Heading">

         Congruence<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Congruence</primary>
         </indexterm> is an aspect of the therapeutic relationship that is characterized by the therapist being genuinely and mindfully present in their interactions with clients. This requires personal awareness and authenticity on behalf of the therapist and the ability to effectively convey this to their client (Kolden et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). To foster congruence, the therapist should be accessible, approachable, and as transparent as they reasonably can be, rather than hiding behind stereotypical roles. Congruence is essential for the transference of empathy and positive regard and allows the therapist and client to recognize and reflect on problematic mind states with openness, thereby deepening security in the therapy relationship (Kolden et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In this way, congruence/genuineness is a crucial aspect of the therapeutic alliance.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0003s05" role="Heading">
      <title>Having Shared Expectations/Providing Hope</title>
      <para role="Para">Our expectations surrounding situations influence our experiences. As such, a client’s beliefs about the effectiveness of psychotherapy are likely to contribute to or hinder their progress. In psychotherapy, the therapist’s explanation of a client’s disorder and the treatment plan they proscribe shape the client’s expectations. It is important to provide clients with an explanation for their difficulties that is accepted by the client, and treatment that is consistent with that explanation (Wampold &amp; Imel,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therefore, the therapist must carefully consider the client’s cultural background<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>background</primary>
         </indexterm> and how this may influence their beliefs and attitude toward mental disorders. As the client comes to believe that participating in and completing the tasks of therapy will be helpful in coping with their symptoms, their expectation that they have the ability to do what is needed to help themselves increases, which results in improvements. The client’s belief that their treatment will provide new perspectives, change, and the possibility for growth is also critically important for the establishment of trust. If the clinician can consistently model and demonstrate this stance of hopefulness, clients will likely experience the freedom and security to more fully disclose and work on their problems.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0003s06" role="Heading">
      <title>Goal Consensus/Collaboration</title>
      <para role="Para">Another key common factor that influences psychotherapy outcomes is goal consensus and collaboration between the therapist and client. As previously mentioned, to maximize success, the therapist should create a well-defined and culturally imbedded treatment plan with specific goals that are understood and agreed upon by both the therapist and client. Tryon and Winograd (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>) caution clinicians against pushing their own agenda, advise clinicians to give the client ample opportunities<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>opportunities</primary>
         </indexterm> to share their input on the objectives and their progress regularly throughout the course of treatment, and to be prepared to make adjustments to the treatment plan according to the client’s feedback. To foster collaboration, they suggest educating clients about the importance of their cooperation in making progress by sharing results of research studies and by encouraging them to complete homework assignments and other agreed-upon tasks.</para>

   <sect2 id="ch0002s0003s07" role="Heading">
      <title>Therapist Effects</title>
      <para role="Para">Variation in treatment outcomes can be partly attributed to therapist effects. Some therapists are more skilled than others, even if they are delivering the same treatments (Laska et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therapists who possess better facilitative interpersonal skills, provide an emotionally activating relationship, and are able to form strong alliances with a diverse range of clients achieve better outcomes. As such, working on yourself is always an ongoing area for professional development<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>development</primary>
