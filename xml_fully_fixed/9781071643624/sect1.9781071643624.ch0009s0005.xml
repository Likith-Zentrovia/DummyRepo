   <title>Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Although rates of bipolar I disorder are roughly equivalent between men and women, rates of bipolar II disorder may be higher for women than men (Diflorio &amp; Jones,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2010</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Similar rates of diagnosis of bipolar disorders are found around the world (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Mc Grath et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Age of onset is typically late adolescence to early adulthood although a smaller subset may develop bipolar disorders in midlife (American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>). More than 70% of individuals with bipolar disorders<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>bipolar disorders</primary>
      </indexterm> present with symptoms before the age of 25 (Jain &amp; Mitra, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2024</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Moreno et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2007</phrase>
      </emphasis>) and the median age of onset of 20 years old worldwide (Mc Grath et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Due to the challenges of diagnosing bipolar disorder, it takes an average of 6–10 years after first contact with a provider for the diagnosis to be confirmed (Dagani et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Fritz et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2017</phrase>
      </emphasis>) with some research showing up to 14 years passing before proper diagnosis (Drancourt et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Race may influence the appropriate diagnosis of bipolar disorders. A collection of research has demonstrated that Black patients with bipolar disorder are more likely to receive an incorrect diagnosis of schizophrenia as compared to other racial groups (Akinhanmi et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Neighbors et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>); this effect was found to hold regardless of the race of the clinician (Neighbors et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Multiple factors may contribute to this phenomenon. Black patients may be more likely to (1) demonstrate psychotic symptoms during manic episodes that are subsequently misconstrued as schizophrenia, (2) display paranoia-like symptoms that may in fact be realistic concerns regarding racist behaviors directed towards them, and (3) show blunted affect, a symptom of schizophrenia, due to cultural differences in the display of emotions or a sense of guardedness when interacting with a non-minority provider (Akinhanmi et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2020</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Kennedy et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2004</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Neighbors et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Regardless of the reasoning behind this phenomenon, it is important for the clinician to be cognizant of this reality when assessing for bipolar disorder, versus attempting<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>attempting</primary>
      </indexterm> to be “color blind” and ignore any potential impacts of race and culture on a patient’s presentation and on a provider’s clinical judgment (Neighbors et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2003</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">Racial differences in the presentation of manic and depressive symptoms could also lead to a missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis among patients from groups that have been historically underrepresented or discriminated against (Li et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Additionally, considerable differences exist in manic and depressive sleep disturbances in Black individuals versus White individuals with bipolar I disorder, with Black individuals experiencing sleep disturbances attributed to manic and depressive episodes<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>episodes</primary>
      </indexterm> at a higher rate than White individuals. Given poor sleep is a risk factor for mood episode recurrence (Gold &amp; Sylvia, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>), addressing sleep symptoms early may result in improved health outcome disparities in underrepresented populations.</para>
   <para role="Para">Minority patients with bipolar disorder may have higher rates of comorbid substance abuse, homelessness, and involuntary hospitalizations when compared to White patients (Kilbourne et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). It has also been posited that structural and cultural barriers experienced by minority patients, including poor access to healthcare and stigma, may lead them to present to care in more severe states of impairment as they may wait longer to seek help (Hwang et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2010</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Patients from differing cultures may tend to report distress in terms of somatic versus psychological symptoms, as has often been observed among Asian patients (Lin &amp; Cheung, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1999</phrase>
      </emphasis>); this is important<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>important</primary>
      </indexterm> for the assessor to keep in mind when evaluating whether a patient meets diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Having said that, while it is important for clinicians to be aware of these types of cultural dynamics, it is equally important to not make assumptions about a patient’s clinical presentation based on their perceived race or ethnicity.</para>
   <para role="Para">The interviewer should take care when considering a patient’s religious beliefs and practices as they may or may not relate to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Religiosity and spirituality have been found to be protective factors that can provide effective coping strategies among those with a mental disorder (De Fazio et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Jackson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). However, religious themes often emerge in the context of hypomanic and manic episodes and therefore certain behaviors and beliefs may represent bipolar symptomatology. It is important for the assessor to differentiate between normative aspects of one’s religious beliefs and marked shifts in their thoughts and behaviors (Ouwehand <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2024</phrase>
      </emphasis>). For instance, the interviewer can ask questions to determine whether the amount of time an individual reports praying or reading religious texts is markedly greater than at other times in the past<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>past</primary>
      </indexterm>, whether the patient’s self-described feelings of transcendence or connection with God are significantly stronger or more intense than usually experienced, whether these feelings or behaviors are in marked contrast to their peers, and whether these shifts occurred in conjunction with the emergence of additional hypomanic or manic symptoms (Michalak et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2006</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Religious content can also be observed in the context of psychosis, including auditory hallucinations of God or spirits, beliefs of possession by the devil, or grandiose delusions of being a savior or God figure (Brewerton, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1994</phrase>
      </emphasis>). As seeing or hearing God<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>God</primary>
      </indexterm> or spirits is normative within certain belief systems, contextual factors must be strongly considered when determining the nature of a patient’s reported experiences.</para>
