      </indexterm>importance of incorporating identity as a contextual factor when considering personality disorder diagnoses. Specifically, this section will present evidence on the impact of several identities, including age, culture, race and ethnicity, sex, gender and gender expression, and sexual orientation on the manifestation of personality disorder symptoms or maladaptive traits and functioning. This section concludes by highlighting the importance of awareness of bias that can result in wrongly pathologizing identities.</para>

            <primary>more</primary>
         </indexterm> difficult to diagnose the disorder in older adults due to cognitive decline that may prevent some older individuals from providing a detailed account of behavioral patterns in their adolescence or young adulthood that will meet ASPD diagnostic criteria (Holzer &amp; Vaughn, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and may contribute to the difference in diagnostic prevalence in younger and older populations. Individuals with ASPD may engage in more risky behaviors, leading to incarceration or death, contributing to further differences in diagnostic prevalence throughout the lifespan (Holzer &amp; Vaughn, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Finally, existing <emphasis>DSM</emphasis> diagnostic criteria for ASPD<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> engaging in behaviors that require substantial energy including physically aggressive behaviors toward others and criminal behaviors. When conducting diagnostic assessments for ASPD, it is important to consider the heterogeneous presentation of aggressive behavior that does not only include physical assaults or criminal behaviors that warrant arrests because physical strength and engagement in criminal behaviors have been shown to decrease with age (Holzer &amp; Vaughn, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2017</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Other<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Other</primary>
         </indexterm> expressions of aggression can include non-violent behaviors such as verbal aggression, purposefully damaging others’ personal properties, intentionally spreading rumors about others, or harassing them indirectly through other means.</para>
      <para role="Para">More recently, some researchers<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>researchers</primary>
         </indexterm>have questioned whether PDs can emerge in older adults. Because the age of onset for DSM-5-TR personality disorders is during adolescence/early adulthood, the onset of personality disorders in older adults is not well-researched. Stone et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>) argue traumatic experiences are strongly associated with personality dysfunction or psychological diagnosis in older adults. In a study that examined the late onset of personality disorders in individuals older than 55, the researchers found the occurrence of a personal illness<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>illness</primary>
         </indexterm> and illness or death of a relative predicted the onset of personality disorders (Dupree et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Dupree et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>) attributed the occurrence of late onset of personality disorders to a change in the individuals’ roles in life from<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>from</primary>
         </indexterm> being “healthy” to “unhealthy” or independent to dependent. This could be an important consideration when conducting diagnostic interviewing of personality disorders in older populations. More generally, due to the unique context of later life, researchers have proposed “geriatric variants” for all of the DSM-based PDs (Segal et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>), which could be used to help clinicians and researchers<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> diagnosis of a PD, it is important to consider cultural differences and how these might impact the presentation of symptoms. The consideration of cultural practices is important in working with individuals from diverse backgrounds because the clinician must consider whether symptom expressions are typical of cultural expressions or a deviance from it. Cultural context can provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual’s symptoms especially as it relates to PD diagnosis because it concerns how a person’s culture is impacting how they think, express how they feel, and react to certain events<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>events</primary>
         </indexterm>. Additionally, one’s cultural expression of feelings and emotions is especially important because some translated versions of Western instruments, especially diagnostic interviews, may not convey the same meaning. For example, some have argued that diagnostic criteria, such as fear of abandonment, are not appropriate in collectivist cultures. Some cultural expressions that may be considered pathological<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>pathological</primary>
         </indexterm>may be common practice in one’s culture, and this could lead to misdiagnosis. For example, in some Indigenous communities, an appropriate expression of grief includes hearing the voices of dead ancestors (Balaratnasingam &amp; Janca, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </indexterm> such as self-poisoning and overdose (Munson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>). This<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>This</primary>
         </indexterm> may be due to discouragement of externally expressing one’s emotions in Eastern nations. Additionally, these methods may be used because poisons and chemicals are more commonly accessible in the regions where the<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>the</primary>
         </indexterm>studies were conducted. In Western nations (e. g., Canada, Croatia, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Western Australia), it was found that skin mutilation was more common. This may be because individuals from Western nations are more emotionally expressive (Munson et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It is not possible or expected of any clinician to be knowledgeable of all people’s cultural backgrounds. However, one’s culture should be considered in diagnostic interviewing of personality disorders to gather more information about the context in which the symptoms may occur. If the clinician is not well-educated<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>well-educated</primary>
         </indexterm> on the individual’s cultural background, it is encouraged that the clinician does the necessary research into the individual’s cultural practices and expressions. It is also important for clinicians to not assume that a patient fully identifies within a specific cultural background, thus clinicians should consider assessing how each<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>each</primary>
         </indexterm>patient identifies with a cultural background. Finally, one’s culture may be informative of the differential stressors such as political and social climates that may impact the onset<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> from diverse, underrepresented, and epistemically excluded populations, clinicians should be aware of personal biases. These biases can impact the type of diagnosis a patient may receive. When conceptualizing a diagnostic assessment, clinicians should be aware of the possible biases that may contribute to their decision of a diagnosis. For example, racial stereotypes associated with certain groups should be of note to prevent bias in diagnostic interviewing and conceptualization. Previous research suggested PDs were more frequently diagnosed in racial and ethnic minoritized groups compared to<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>to</primary>
         </indexterm>their White counterparts (e. g., Grant et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">However, more recent research<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>research</primary>
         </indexterm>has found that some racial and ethnic groups may have lower prevalence rates of personality disorders than White populations. In a meta-analysis that examined how race and ethnicity impacted the prevalence of PDs, individuals who identified as Black had a lower rate of diagnosis of a personality disorder than individuals who identified as White (Mc Gilloway et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). When comparing rates of PD diagnoses of individuals who identified as Asian and White, there were no statistically significant differences.

         </indexterm> were found<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>found</primary>
         </indexterm>to be more likely to be diagnosed with a PD. The authors concluded that while the significantly lower diagnoses of PDs in Black populations could be a true lower prevalence rate, this also could<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>could</primary>
         </indexterm>be due to potential neglect of assessing PD diagnoses in ethnic groups (Mc Gilloway et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In another more recent study that examined PDs across racial groups from hospital admissions data across 6 years, they found that Black and other minority ethnic groups had lower prevalence rates of PDs than the White British population (Hossain et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Whether racially and ethnically minority groups are over or underrepresented in PD diagnosis, it is important to be aware of potential diagnostic biases against racial and ethnic groups. It is important for the assessing clinician to be aware of their own biases<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>biases</primary>

An individual’s gender identity may impact the diagnosis they receive due to potential biases that some clinicians have toward gender identities. Alternatively, a person’s sex and gender identity can impact how symptoms present due to the association of certain behaviors with different gender identities. For<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> may display more overt mood fluctuation, fear of abandonment, and interpersonal difficulties due to societal associations and expectations of femininity while a cisgender man with BPD may feel pressured to suppress their emotional oscillations and express it through overtly aggressive behaviors or risk-taking behaviors to align more with societal expectations of masculinity. Research shows differential behavioral correlates in men and women diagnosed with BPD (Sher et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>). In individuals diagnosed with ASPD, women were found to have committed less antisocial acts than men. Additionally, boys later diagnosed with ASPD may have an earlier onset of conduct disorder and are more likely to engage in aggressive acts than adolescent girls.

However, even after controlling for these clinical correlates, the diagnostic disparity between sexual<indexterm significance="normal">

         </emphasis>) also investigated diagnostic disparity in diagnostic instruments in this group.
