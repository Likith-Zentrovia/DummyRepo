It’s a constant battle and there are days where I just give in and let her stay home. At night, her father and I have just given in at this point. She’s sleeping in our bed every night and her younger brother—he’s seven—is sleeping alone in his room. So, I know this isn’t typical.

So I usually try to answer as soon as I see it because I figure it’s probably better that she’s in her classroom, but I don’t know. It’s hard to keep up with this. At the most recent parent-teacher conference, I found out that she was getting B’s and C’s now and she’s always been a straight A<indexterm significance="normal">

   <para role="Para">The semi-structured interview format allowed the clinician to ask follow-up questions after the child’s “yes” or “no” response. Given what the clinician knew from the interview with Mrs. X, the clinician was able to expand on Katie’s responses to gather clarifying information regarding the cause of some of Katie’s behaviors. After the interview with Katie, the clinician completed the ADIS-5-C/P with Mrs. X to gather more information.</para>
   <para role="Para">When making the diagnosis, the clinician brought together the information obtained from Mrs. X and Katie, as well as behavioral observations. It was clear from the interviews that Katie’s behaviors were consistent with a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Mrs. X noted that these behaviors (e. g., difficulty sleeping on her<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>her</primary>
      </indexterm>own, distress at separation, and checking on her parents when separated) had been present for greater than 4 weeks and were causing her significant distress and impairment. Katie explained that her difficulty separating was related to her fear that something bad would happen to her parents. Using the ADIS-5-C/P, the clinician was also able to rule out other comorbid diagnoses (e. g., generalized anxiety disorder). Katie denied significant worries in any other domain other than worrying about her parents’ safety. Mrs. X also denied any other significant areas of worry. Because of this, the clinician diagnosed Katie with separation anxiety disorder and offered Mrs. X several recommendations for addressing these concerns,including<indexterm significance="normal">
