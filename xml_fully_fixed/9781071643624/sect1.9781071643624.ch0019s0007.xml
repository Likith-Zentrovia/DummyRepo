      </indexterm> experienced failure and rejection in many domains of their lives. This may result in a more guarded, reticent, or withdrawn presentation in interview. The interviewer may need to work a bit harder to establish rapport and set the patient at ease. Experiencing positive symptoms of schizophrenia may be distressing and<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>and</primary>
      </indexterm>frightening to the patient, and a warm empathic approach can ease this distress and enhance the information gained during the interview. Avoid using jargon and instead use the interviewee’s own words to refer to psychotic episodes (e. g., nervous breakdown). Some associated symptoms and cognitive impairment may result in longer latencies and less coherence to an interviewee’s responses. A good diagnostic interviewer will tailor the interview to accommodate the interviewee’s limitations. A patient and gentle interview style can facilitate engagement in the interview<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>interview</primary>
      </indexterm> process while helping the interviewer obtain the most accurate information possible. Lastly, depending on the clinical context, a diagnostic interview may represent one of the interviewee’s first contacts with the mental health system. Thus, the interviewer should attempt to maximize the engagement in treatment by making the interview experience as person-centered and positive as possible.</para>

         <primary>interview</primary>
      </indexterm> is recommended, it is also important to remember the purpose of the interview. Many novice interviewers have a tendency to respond therapeutically to any sign of distress. This type of response is not always necessary and can make interview process much lengthier and inefficient resulting in a disservice to both interviewee and interviewer. The purpose of the interview is to determine a diagnosis, often to inform a course of treatment. Therefore, throughout the interview an interviewer should be asking herself/himself: how is this statement or question relevant to determining a diagnosis? Of course, there may be occasions where an interviewee is too distressed to participate in a diagnostic interview. An interviewer will need to use clinical judgment as to how and when<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>when</primary>
      </indexterm> to respond to distress and ultimately if it is necessary to terminate the interview and reschedule.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis>Don’t apologize for questions related to psychotic experiences</emphasis>. Novice interviewers may have a tendency<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>tendency</primary>
      </indexterm>to apologize for questions, or qualify questions (e. g., “this next question may be difficult for you to answer”). There also may be a tendency to avoid questions based<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>based</primary>
      </indexterm> on the perception that the interviewee will become upset or will not be able to answer. Instead, a matter of fact and direct approach is recommended. Interviewees are often quite open to sharing their experiences, and individuals with schizophrenia are no exception. One should not automatically assume that they will not want to answer or can’t handle certain questions. Simultaneously, one should avoid becoming overly fascinated by psychotic phenomena to the detriment of the interview.</para>
   <para role="Para">
      <emphasis>Do avoid arguing with interviewees about the veracity of their psychotic experience.</emphasis> It is unlikely that an interviewer would openly argue with an interviewee about her delusional beliefs. However, the interviewer should be prepared with a response in the event that he is asked whether or not they agree with an interviewee’s beliefs or experiences. Often the interviewer can deflect such questions by making a matter of fact and nonjudgmental statement like: “I haven’t had any experiences like that. I’m really just interested in hearing more about what your experiences have been with [psychotic symptom].” The reader is referred to other clinical approaches based on motivational<indexterm significance="normal">

It may require a bit more time up front to determine such a time frame, but it is worthwhile if it can assist the interviewee in accurately recounting symptoms retrospectively. As discussed above, the time course of symptoms is critical to determining a diagnosis of schizophrenia and making a differential diagnosis regarding mood episodes, PTSD, and possible substance-related symptoms.</para>
