   <para role="Para">The mental status examination (MSE)<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>mental status examination (MSE)</primary>
      </indexterm> is a structured assessment of the clinically relevant areas of a client’s behavioral, emotional, and cognitive functioning. By coalescing observations from these domains, the MSE paints a picture of the client at a given point in time and helps the clinician form a working hypothesis about a client’s psychiatric diagnosis/es and functioning<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>functioning</primary>
      </indexterm>. A standardized approach and focused questions allow the clinician<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>clinician</primary>
      </indexterm> to assess multiple domains<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>domains</primary>
      </indexterm>—and ascertain patterns across domains<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>domains</primary>

         <emphasis>The client was a 69-year-old, Spanish speaking, Hispanic white man who appeared younger than his stated age. He was of average weight and dressed appropriately in tailored slacks and a button-up shirt. Intact grooming and hygiene were noted, as evidenced by neatly trimmed hair and fingernails and a closely clipped beard. He was cooperative with his examiner and translator but responded in a very concise manner to the examiner’s questions without much elaboration. Over the course of the interview, he became more forthcoming and at times tearful. He evidenced an anxious affect, sitting with his hands clenched and often averting eye contact to stare at the floor.</emphasis>

         <emphasis>A 42-year-old multiracial, nonbinary (pronouns: they/them) person presented 20 minutes late to their appointment, arriving via bus with their adult daughter. A lack of grooming and hygiene was evident. Mx. Jones was disheveled; their clothes appeared unwashed and stained, and their hair appeared unwashed and unbrushed. They left their sunglasses on during the interview and would rise frequently from the chair to walk around the room and mutter incomprehensibly. They had a notable body odor of stale cigarette smoke. Mx. Jones appeared apathetic and evidenced poor insight, responding to the examiner’s questions with phrases such as “I don’t know. She brought my here,” referring to their daughter.</emphasis>

Each vignette raises different clinical hypotheses and suggests different lines of inquiry during the interview.</para>
