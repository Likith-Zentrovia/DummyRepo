   <title>Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">During formal assessments, it is important to remain cognizant and actively consider an individual’s biological and sociocultural experiences as they may impact their suicide risk. While certain populations have historically posed the greatest risk of suicide deaths (e. g., white males), other subpopulations have been increasing at alarming rates (e. g., Hispanics; Khubchandani &amp; Price,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Overall, a little less than 50% of all people who suffer from suicidal thoughts<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>suicidal thoughts</primary>
      </indexterm> and behaviors actually disclose their experiences making identification and treatment difficult (Hallford et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2023</phrase>
      </emphasis>). The following section reviews the intersectionality of suicidality with various demographic and sociocultural identities, including the consideration of differing tendencies related to disclosures of suicide risk.</para>

      <title>Sex and Gender Differences</title>
      <para role="Para">The gender paradox<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>paradox</primary>
         </indexterm> has been well studied in the suicidology field (Canetto &amp; Sakinofsky, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1998</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Schrijvers et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). When looking through a biological lens, suicidal ideation and non-lethal behavior rates tend to be higher for females whereas males have higher rates of suicide mortality (Beautrais, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2002</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Bommersbach et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Males tend to choose more lethal methods, but a range of other methodological and sociocultural factors can also explain their increased risk. As Cibis et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) suggest, males’ level of suicidal intent, help-seeking behaviors, substance use, aggression, and impulsivity all play a role in increasing their risk. Clinicians should be aware when formally assessing individuals that both biological sex and gender identity alter one’s suicide risk. In a meta-analysis conducted<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>conducted</primary>
         </indexterm>by Surace et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>) of ten studies from mostly Western cultures, gender non-conforming youth had higher prevalence rates of suicidality than their cisgender peers. The authors noted how experiences with stigmatization, minority stress, peer victimization, social isolation, and comorbidities especially affect individuals with gender dysphoria. Suicide risk assessments should therefore<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>therefore</primary>
         </indexterm> include opportunities for individuals to share such stressors.</para>
      <para role="Para">Another study looked at sex differences in disclosure of suicide thoughts<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>suicide thoughts</primary>
         </indexterm> and behaviors (Balt et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Researchers interviewed family and friends of youth decedents to gauge any differences in frequency, primacy, mode (e. g., verbal, nonverbal, and written), and content of suicide-related communications. They also investigated who individuals preferred as a confidant for disclosing their suicidality. Males tended to disclose their suicidality experiences later, in closer proximity to their deaths compared to females. Males also indirectly communicated their suicidality (e. g., hints, jokes, and broad questions about death) while females were more explicit. Females frequently self-harmed and wrote about their suicidality privately (i. e., journals, stories, drawings). Females more frequently sought help and disclosed their suicidal ideation. Respondents reported that males seemed more verbally aggressive and communicated their frustration, whereas females spoke of<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>of</primary>
         </indexterm> their guilt and burdensomeness. If males did disclose their suicidality, it was only to family, partners, and friends. Females boasted a larger range of confidants, from family, close friends, peers (online and from school), and healthcare professionals. The results of this study can help to inform formal suicidality assessments, particularly when gathering information from multiple informants (collateral information). But further research is needed to replicate and expand these findings beyond<indexterm significance="normal">

      <title>Cultural and Racial Differences</title>
      <para role="Para">A brief review of literature<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>literature</primary>
         </indexterm> and national data reveals the disproportionate rate at which racial and ethnic minorities are dying by suicide. At the forefront are American Indian and Alaskan Natives, followed by non-Hispanic Whites (CDC, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Curtin, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Alarmingly, African American—especially black youth—suicide prevalence rates are growing the fastest with recent estimates around 11.8% (Bridge et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Ivey-Stephenson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Similarly, the US Hispanic population has experienced increasing suicide rates over the years especially pronounced in youth populations (Meza &amp; Bath, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These increasing rates are outpacing the field’s attempts to develop culturally responsive suicide assessment tools (Molock et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Cultural and racial identities impact an individual’s perception and therefore experience of suicidality. For example,Hispanic<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Hispanic</primary>
         </indexterm>individual’s beliefs (i. e., machismo and marianismo), nativity, acculturation, and values (familismo and religion) have all been tied to their experiences of suicidality (Barranco,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Bersani &amp; Morabito, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>

            <phrase>2000</phrase>

         </emphasis>; Silva et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In lieu of well-validated tools designed for varied cultural contexts, clinicians are encouraged to take an open approach with their selected measures. The bare minimum is for all suicide assessments to provide individuals with the opportunity to reflect how their cultural and racial identities influence their suicidality.</para>
      <para role="Para">One’s cultural experiences can<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>can</primary>
         </indexterm> impact their ability and willingness for suicidality disclosure. Help-seeking behaviors are already low in individuals who suffer from suicidality (Mann et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2005</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Ethnic and racial minorities must also overcome what Yu et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) describe as the “double stigma,” or the compounding experience of discrimination based on both racial identity and mental health diagnostic status. These researchers did observe that racial stigma increased Black adults’ perceived barriers to seeking mental healthcare. It is also important to note that medical mistrust, especially among the African American community given their historical mistreatment, impacts their willingness to seek mental healthcare to this day (Colvin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2024</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therefore, culturally competent clinicians must consistently recognize the systematic and individual barriers ethnically and racially diverse individuals must overcome to participate in formal assessments.</para>
      <para role="Para">Unsurprisingly, these trends and barriers are consistently noted within young adult population research. In a sample<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>sample</primary>
         </indexterm> of college students, ethnic minority clients took longer to disclose suicidal ideation, and most only reported their suicidality when prompted by the clinician (Morrison &amp; Downey, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In a follow-up study, Morrison<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Morrison</primary>
         </indexterm> and Downey<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Downey</primary>
         </indexterm> recorded that African American students tended to list more reasons for living than their White peers. Moreover, the survey revealed that the African American students have stronger moral objections to suicide. In sum, one’s cultural and racial backgrounds undoubtedly affect how one thinks about and communicates their suicidality. Clinicians conducting suicide risk assessments must foster their own cultural competency knowledge to best serve their all populations—particularly those from marginalized communities.</para>

      <title>Age Differences</title>
      <para role="Para">Trends in suicide risk<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>risk</primary>
         </indexterm> across age groups continue to evolve. Since 2009, suicide rates for individuals aged 10–24 have been on the rise (Curtin &amp; Garnett, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Based on the latest data for 2022, suicide has been a top 10 leading cause of death from ages 10 years old to 54 years old (CDC, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Furthermore, the data has shown that suicide is the second leading cause of death for individuals aged 10–34 years old with rates declining into later adulthood. Scholars have been dedicated to understanding the development and sustainment of suicidality across age groups. This research is helpful for clinicians when formulating case conceptualizations from suicide risk assessments.</para>
      <para role="Para">A large-scale study was recently conducted with the United States’ National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) suicide deaths data from 2017 to 2019 (Choi et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The data set included reports from death certificates, to medical examiners, law enforcement officers, and even family and friends close to the decedents (<emphasis>N</emphasis> = 94,454, ages 18–105). They observed that suicidal ideation disclosure was highest in those aged 18–44 rather than the latter age groups spanning 45+. Much like<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>like</primary>
         </indexterm> previous research has established, disclosure of suicidality across age groups was most often to partners, family, friends, and colleagues. Despite being the lowest disclosure group, 65+ individuals disclosed their suicidality to healthcare professionals the most out of any comparison age group. Moreover, they found an interaction between grief and disclosure. Those within the 65+ age group that were grieving a family member or friend were more likely to disclose their suicidal ideation. The researchers also studied the included age groups varied propensity toward certain lethal methods. Those that went on to die<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>die</primary>
         </indexterm>by suicide either by firearms or poisoning were more likely to disclose their suicidality at some point prior to their death. In contrast, those who died by hanging and suffocation had lower rates of suicidal ideation disclosure. This is concerning considering hanging and suffocation were found to be highest within those aged 45 or younger—the age group at highest risk of dying by suicide.</para>
      <para role="Para">As this research supports, suicide assessments should always include a discussion of plans and preparatory behaviors as certain age and method pairings are of particular concern. Building on Choi<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Choi</primary>
         </indexterm> and colleagues’ findings, a study utilizing Dutch National Survey data from 2016 also found alarming rates of non-disclosure of suicidality in adults (Mérelle et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These rates were heavily related to adult’s self-reported levels of social loneliness. This research reminds us of the many precipitating factors that<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>that</primary>
         </indexterm> interact to effect suicide risk across the lifespan and necessitates a multi-faceted suicide assessment and treatment process. We need assessments that will help clinicians to identify and target often overlooked groups of people—those who tend to not disclose.</para>
      <para role="Para">A high level of clinical thought and care is needed when assessing children and adolescents. An immediate youth suicide risk assessment concern is the concept of conditional confidentiality. Sometimes working in the best interest of youth patients (i. e., minors) requires clinicians to break confidentiality, or notify parents of thoughts and behaviors youth have disclosed in private. Within the context of suicidality, adolescents tend to filter or withhold from reporting their experiences in fear of confidentiality breaches and the consequences (e. g., judgment and reactions) thereafter (Fox et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). This fear is exacerbated for vulnerable populations, such as those from racial<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>racial</primary>
         </indexterm>and sexual minorities. One study found that adolescents from marginalized racial and gender-minoritized communities often chose to not disclose their suicide-related experiences out of fear of judgment (Shin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Therefore, clinicians assessing for suicide risk should remain updated on their state-level age of medical consent and ensure the universal understanding of conditional confidentiality with all key stakeholders.</para>
      <para role="Para">It takes a tremendous amount of courage for youths to be open and honest about their suicidality—particularly because of the inherent confidentiality breach risk. Especially with younger children, clinicians may think to rectify youth’s unreliable reports by heavily weighting parent reports. However,parents<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>parents</primary>
         </indexterm> similarly may be inaccurate reporters of their children’s suicide risk which can lead to an increase of “false positives.” Children may have a natural curiosity about death which may be overemphasized by parents. Parent reports are undoubtedly helpful in suicide risk assessments and can be used to validate child self-reports. Regardless, a clinician’s priority should be to conduct a developmentally<indexterm significance="normal">
