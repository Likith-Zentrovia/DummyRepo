   <title>Preliminary Factors to Consider</title>
   <para role="Para">Before diving into the process and components of a clinical interview, there are a few preliminary factors clinicians should consider.</para>
   <sect2 id="ch0004s0001s01" role="Heading">
      <title>Interviewing Efficiently</title>
      <para role="Para">In the current environment of limited reimbursable hours by insurers, clinicians must prioritize efficiency during the clinical interview<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>interview</primary>
         </indexterm> and assessment process. To streamline the process, clinicians may consider using biopsychosocial self-report screening measures to obtain preliminary information on the client’s symptom patterns. In cases where clients deny a symptom or problem on a screener, basic questioning during the clinical interview is adequate to obtain information about symptom patterns, allowing more time for in-depth exploration of relevant concerns<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>concerns</primary>
         </indexterm>. If, after completing the initial interview, the clinician realizes that more information is needed, follow-up questions can be asked in additional meetings with the client.</para>

      <title>Interview with the Intake Report and Feedback in Mind</title>
      <para role="Para">A clinician can minimize the likelihood of client surprise or discomfort during feedback (e. g., receiving unexpected outcomes) by conducting a person-centered interview with the end results in mind. Effective interviews provide information the clinician can use to generate an intake report that is informative and useful for treatment planning (see Segal &amp; Hutchings,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>). It can also be used to provide meaningful feedback, leaving the client with a better understanding of their presenting concerns. Throughout the interview, the clinician should explore symptom and behavior patterns in a way that can be referenced again during the feedback session (e. g., “Remember how you told me about [symptom or behavior pattern], well that is consistent with other people who are diagnosed with [DSM-5-TR disorder]”). When interviewing with the report and feedback in mind, the clinician strategically frames questions to elicit information that guides clients through the interview with sensitivity to potential outcomes. By skillfully integrating the client’s narratives and experiences into the interview process, clinicians ensure that diagnostic outcomes are not unexpected, but rather rooted in a comprehensive exploration of the client’s symptoms and behavioral patterns.</para>

      <title>Monitor Cues for Underreporting, Overreporting, and Additional Information</title>
      <para role="Para">Throughout the interview, the clinician should be mindful of cues indicating the client may be either underreporting or overreporting symptoms and listen for opportunities to obtain additional information. Detecting underreporting or overreporting requires the clinician to interview tactfully with follow-up on inconsistent information, which can help ensure the information is reliable and valid. This may involve asking follow-up questions for inconsistent information and building rapport with the client to facilitate their motivation for accurate disclosure. Clinicians should monitor for signs of secondary gain, such as seeking a diagnosis for access to medication or disability benefits. Clients may also exhibit non-verbal behavior that may signal discomfort with a specific topic of conversation. They may also organically mention information from other sources (e. g., referring to prior medical or psychiatric diagnoses or previous testing). Though it may interrupt the clinician’s assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>assessment</primary>
         </indexterm> flow, it can be more effective to ask about this information now, followed by a return to the previous point in the interview after a brief exploration of the new information.</para>
