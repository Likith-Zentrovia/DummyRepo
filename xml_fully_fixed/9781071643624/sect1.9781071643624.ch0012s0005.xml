   <title>Impact of Culture, Gender, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</title>
   <para role="Para">Culture informs the psychological processes of both evaluation and treatment. It is an imperative factor that should be considered by the clinician from the diagnostic phase and throughout treatment. The perception of culture usually refers to race or gender. However, culture can be defined around common themes such as age, religion, social standing, education, financial resources, or veterans’<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>status</primary>
      </indexterm>. Culture is complex and multi-faceted. For example, an individual may define herself as Hispanic, female, veteran, and Catholic. She belongs to multiple cultural groups rather than just one. Multiple cultural identities may play a significant role in an individual’s comprehension, understanding, and presentation of their mental health symptoms, as well as influence the treatment process and outcomes. Mental health professionals are responsible for being knowledgeable and sensitive to cultural considerations and their potential impact on assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment. Cultural competency is especially relevant when providing treatment for trauma-related disorders: while the self-cognition (e. g., “who I am”) of individuals from independent cultures (e. g., the USA or Europe) who experienced trauma is significantly defined by the trauma, it is much less so for individuals who experienced trauma from interdependent cultures (e. g., South America or Southeast Asia) (Maercker &amp; Horn,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2013</phrase>
      </emphasis>.). These findings are both theoretically and clinically significant. Theoretically, the findings highlight how social norms influence the perception of trauma. Clinically, the findings bolster the existing recommendation that mental health professionals strive to be culturally competent (i. e., knowledge, skills, and attitude).</para>

      <title>Gender and Age</title>
      <para role="Para">Ample research suggests a positive correlation between gender, age, and posttraumatic symptoms. A meta-analysis of 77 studies revealed that both the risk of<emphasis>experiencing</emphasis> traumatic events as well as endorsing PTSD symptomatology was significantly associated with being female, younger, and lower social class status (Brewin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>). A study by Ditlevsen and Elklit (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) supported these findings in a sample of 6548 Nordic people using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-Part IV (HTQ-IV). The study found that 27.5% of women and 13.8% of men endorsed PTSD symptoms (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">There is research that also indicates that PTSD is likely to have different developmental trajectories for men and women (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Reynolds et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Overall, multiple studies suggest that PTSD prevalence is lower in late life among both males and females (Brewin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>; Reynolds et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, men showed a decline in HTQ scores in their 40s and the lowest potential for PTSD risk in their 60s to mid-80s (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In the late 80s to 90s, higher rates of PTSD were evident for men (Reynolds et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Among women, a decrease in PTSD symptoms occurred a decade later than in men (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and continued to decline steadily into late life (Reynolds et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <title>Racial and Ethnic Minorities</title>
      <para role="Para">In general, studies indicate that racial and ethnic minorities experience more mental health diagnostic inaccuracies as well as disparities in treatment when compared to their White counterparts (Fortuna et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Samnaliev et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, research suggests that the prevalence of lifetime mental disorders among African American, Latino, and Asian adults is lower than Whiles in the USA (Mc Laughlin et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). One possible explanation is that minorities are more resilient in the face of traumatic exposure (Mclaughlin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2019</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Data from a structured diagnostic interview administered to 34,653 adults revealed that minorities reported lower exposure to traumatic events in comparison to Whites (Roberts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD was found to be highest among African Americans (8.7%) in comparison to Whites and Hispanics (7.4% and 7.0%, respectively) and lowest among Asians (4.0%) (Roberts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The relatively high prevalence of lifetime PTSD among African Americans may be explained by factors such as discrimination, racial stigmatization, and racial-based abuse, as well as lower socio-economic conditions (Roberts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). While African Americans are at greater risk for developing PTSD than Whites or other minorities, they are less likely to seek and receive mental health treatment for their trauma. Only 35.3% of Blacks with PTSD symptoms sought any type of treatment (e. g., physician or psychologist) versus 53.3% of Whites with similar symptomology (Roberts et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Also, only 42% of Hispanics and 32.7% of Asians sought any form of treatment for the disorder. The comparatively low percentage of minorities using mental health treatment for their PTSD symptoms can be explained by several factors, such as negative mental health stigma, cultural beliefs, poor quality or limited availability of resources, and racism or bias in treatment settings (Conner et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">A significant negative association between stigma and mental health treatment was also found among American Middle Eastern (i. e., Arab or Israeli) individuals (Clement et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Additional explanations, other than stigma, for a lower percentage of treatment-seeking and use among minorities can be attributed to socio-economic issues (e. g., health insurance plan with coverage for adequate mental health treatment) and knowledge (e. g., education about the options available).</para>

      <title>Sexual Minority Adults</title>
      <para role="Para">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) people living in the USA are more likely to encounter sexual abuse, crime, verbal harassment, and various types of discrimination in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts (Herek,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2009</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Rothman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The higher likelihood<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>likelihood</primary>
         </indexterm> of victimization explains why sexual minorities also have a higher risk for PTSD (Roberts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In an extensive study of 34,653 noninstitutionalized adults living in the USA, Roberts et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>) found that the PTSD prevalence among (self-defined) gay and bisexual men who were exposed to a potentially traumatic event was 13.38% and 9%, respectively, in comparison to 5.03% among heterosexual men with no same-sex attractions or partners. The study also found that PTSD prevalence among lesbian and bisexual women was 18.04% and 25.68%, in contrast to 12.50% among heterosexual women without same-sex attractions (Roberts et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These differences in rates for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people are consistent with findings reported by earlier studies (Gilman et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2001</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Herek et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1999</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Transgender individuals are disproportionately impacted both by exposure to trauma and the higher prevalence of PTSD. A study by Reisner et al. (2016) among 412 transgender adults found the mean number of discrimination attributions endorsed was 4.6. The most common reasons for discrimination were gender identity and expression (83%), masculine and feminine appearance (79%), and sexual orientation (68%). In addition, the study found that it is the combination of higher everyday discrimination and more significant reasons for discrimination experiences that were independently correlated with PTSD symptoms.</para>

            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The study also found that a significant number of the sample avoided using at least one (25%) or two or more (15.4%) VHA services due to fear of stigmatization (Simpson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <title>The Armed Forces</title>
      <para role="Para">PTSD and other trauma-related disorders have been extensively studied among military service members and veterans returning from war. Violent combat exposure has been associated with severe mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress, depression, substance use, and risk for death by suicide (Boscarino,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <primary>Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)</primary>
         </indexterm> research examining the prevalence of PTSD among service members and veterans post-deployment found a strong positive correlation between participation in battle and PTSD (Ramchand et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">A meta-analysis of 22 studies examining PTSD and other trauma-related disorders among service members returning from OEF and OIF found significant variability in rates for PTSD (Ramchand et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2010</phrase>
         </emphasis>), ranging from a high of 60% among Army National Guard soldiers serving in Iraq (Stecker et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>) to a low of 1.6% among Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan (Larson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>). While the prevalence of PTSD varied among the studies, there were additional studies where service members completed Department of Defense (DoD) Post Deployment Health Assessment questionnaires within 2 weeks of returning home from service in Iraq. These studies estimated that PTSD rates were approximately 10% (Hoge et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Milliken et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2007</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, Ramchand et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>) also reported that reassessment of the same participants 6 months after their return from Iraq showed higher PTSD rates. Possible explanations for this increase could be the underreporting of symptoms or the gradual development of symptoms when reintegrating into society (Ramchand et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Studies have also found a positive correlation between trauma and health-related problems among veterans. Specifically, chronic PTSD was associated with heart disease, as well as with an increased risk of developing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Boscarino,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2006</phrase>
         </emphasis>, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>). To summarize, while PTSD and trauma-related disorders are extensively studied among service members and veterans, there is still a lot more to learn. Although different studies often produce different or conflicting results, sometimes due to the use of different measures, the sample studied, or the duration of the study (e. g., single or multiple time points), it is evident that service members and veterans are at higher risk for PTSD than the civilian population.</para>

      <title>Integrating Cultural Considerations into Case Conceptualization</title>
      <para role="Para">Cultural awareness should be a standard part of clinical practice. Learning about your client’s race, ethnicity, primary language, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, and military service is necessary for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Familiarity with recent research concerning the client’s culture and potential idioms of distress is also recommended. The client’s sex and gender can influence the reporting of symptoms. For example, a study found that men who worked in high-stress jobs, such as firefighters, tend to under-report symptoms of trauma (Skeffington et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2016</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Similarly, women refugees<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>refugees</primary>
         </indexterm> of Southeast Asian descent were likely to under-report symptoms of trauma resulting from rape because of stigma and shame (Kroll et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>1989</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The DSM-IV was the first to introduce the Outline for Cultural Formulation (OCF) to help clinicians organize and integrate cultural considerations of their clients into case formulation (Lewis-Fernández et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The OCF was revised into a semi-structured interview format and included in the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation of Diagnosis (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The purpose of the CFD is to operationalize the process of cultural considerations as part of the case formulation (Lewis-Fernández et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). More psychometrically sound assessment tools are needed to detect cultural considerations that should be integrated into diagnosis and treatment.</para>
