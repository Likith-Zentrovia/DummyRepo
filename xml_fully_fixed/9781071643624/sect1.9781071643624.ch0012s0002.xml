   <title>Procedures for Gathering Information</title>
   <para role="Para">A strong working alliance between the mental health professional and the client is necessary when assessing for mental health problems and working toward achieving correct diagnosis, as well as treatment goals. This is especially true when assessing for trauma-related disorders because the phenotype of PTSD is often confusing and difficult to identify, as it can be masked or exacerbated by other disorders such as traumatic brain injury, depression, substance use, or anxiety disorder. In addition, people may not realize they have PTSD because they view their symptoms as a sign that they are having difficulty coping (i. e., “there’s something wrong with me”) (Ellis &amp; Zaretsky,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">The foundation of a good therapeutic alliance is a collaborative relationship where an affective bond between the clinician and the client develops and facilitates the process of agreeing on and progressing with selected treatment goals (Lilienfeld et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2012</phrase>
      </emphasis>). To elicit good information, it is worthwhile taking the time to create a sense of safety so that the client feels comfortable sharing private details about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. To establish a therapeutic alliance, it is critical to express compassion, show a genuine interest in the client’s concerns, and engage the client as a collaborator in treatment. Client collaboration can be obtained through mutually setting goals for treatment and sharing impressions of the treatment and progress. Reviewing assessment<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>assessment</primary>
      </indexterm> results with the client and providing psychoeducation have the potential to enhance the therapeutic alliance as it can assuage the client’s concerns about the source of their distress and their ability to cope and change. It is incumbent to continue gathering relevant information and monitoring progress at each stage of therapy.<phrase>10.2</phrase>

   <para role="Para">When appropriate, it is also beneficial to obtain information from collateral sources such as family members, spouses, partners, or close friends, as they can shed light on the client’s behavior and current concerns. However, any interviews with a third party should be done with the client’s informed consent. Because of the clinician’s primary legal and ethical responsibility to maintain the client’s confidentiality, obtaining a client’s verbal consent and securing a client-signed Release of Information (ROI) form is advisable.</para>
   <para role="Para">While interviews are the first step in forming a diagnosis, it is also essential to let the client actively participate in the evaluation process. Information from cognitive and mood assessments can inform case conceptualization and guide treatment planning if the client has given their best effort in responding and is forthcoming when completing measures. Self-report measures, where the client rates their distress levels and endorses the presence and magnitude of various symptoms, are psychology’s most widely used measurement tools (Haeffel &amp; Howard,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2010</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Indeed, there are a variety of trauma and stressor-related disorder self-report measures that can be used to identify the symptoms, rate their onset and severity, as well as monitor for any change in diagnosis throughout treatment. Some self-report measures can help the clinician and client monitor whether the treatment is effective.</para>
