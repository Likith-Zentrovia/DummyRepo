            <primary>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)</primary>
         </indexterm> was developed for and included in the <emphasis>DSM-5</emphasis> (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>) as a means of improving differential diagnosis in children, as rates of misdiagnosis were high (Chilakamarri et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2011</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and led to concerns about inappropriate or delayed access to appropriate treatment. DMDD is marked by chronic and severe irritability as evidenced by persistent anger and irritable mood interspersed with frequent behavioral outbursts. Behavioral symptoms include repeated verbal or physical outbursts, occurring approximately three times per week, which represent behaviors above and beyond what is merited by a given situation. Further, the outbursts must occur outside of typical levels of development. Associated moods are otherwise consistently irritable day-to-day and readily evident to others (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Symptoms must occur for at least 12 months without gaps larger than 3 months in symptom presence (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Moreover, the symptoms must occur in multiple (a minimum of two) settings with at least one setting in which symptoms are severe. The onset of symptoms typically occurs before age 10, and initial diagnosis must occur between the ages of 6–18 years. Importantly, there must be no evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes, which is used to differentiate symptoms of DMDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>DMDD</primary>
         </indexterm> from symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder. As with other <emphasis>DSM-5</emphasis> disorders, other diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder must not better account for the outbursts and irritable mood, and neither substance use nor physical conditions may be responsible for the behaviors associated with DMDD. Studies have reported a high comorbidity of DMDD with other behavioral disorders, including Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Axelson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Upwards of 5% of children from clinical samples display the primary DMDD feature of persistent irritability, and the estimated three-month prevalence rate of DMDD in a community sample ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%, with 1% meeting full criteria (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>; Copeland et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>
         </emphasis>). DMDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>DMDD</primary>
         </indexterm> is most frequently diagnosed in early childhood and affects preschoolers the most (Copeland et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2013</phrase>

            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Notably, sociocultural factors may affect the presentation of core symptoms of DMDD (e. g., impulsivity, emotion, behavior regulation), especially in contexts impacted by severe social disruption (e. g., post-conflict zones or communities affected by systemic racism and discrimination) (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

         </emphasis>)</para>
      <para role="Para">MDD must be differentiated from normal feelings of bereavement or grief in response to loss (e. g., losing a significant other, losing physical ability following a medical condition). Symptoms associated with MDD may certainly overlap with those of grief and bereavement (e. g., changes in appetite or weight), yet MDD can only be diagnosed if an MDE is established. Given the prevalence of bereavement in late life, clinicians and researchers should take care not to misdiagnose intense grief reactions as MDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MDD</primary>
         </indexterm> in older adults (Wakefield &amp; First, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Thus, it is essential to approach diagnosis holistically and in consideration of personal history and relevant cultural factors (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">MDD can be classified based on severity, recurrence, presence of psychosis, and level of remission (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). <emphasis>Mild</emphasis>, <emphasis>moderate</emphasis>, or <emphasis>severe</emphasis> specifiers are assigned based on the number of symptoms present and the degree to which they impair functioning. For example, mild MDD is present if the minimum number of criteria is met, functional ability is not significantly disrupted, and impairment is small but controllable. Moderate and severe MDD are present when more symptoms are endorsed, symptoms are increasingly distressing, and impairment is significant. Recurrent episodes of MDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MDD</primary>
         </indexterm> may be present if criteria are met for subsequent episodes occurring at least 2 months apart. MDD <emphasis>with psychosis</emphasis> can also occur in which someone experiences hallucinations and/or delusions in addition to symptoms of MDD. Psychosis during MDD is usually a sign of severity of the presentation. Remission status is based on the number of criteria present following diagnosis of MDD; specifically, one is in <emphasis>partial remission</emphasis> if symptoms have decreased or been absent for less than 2 months and in <emphasis>full remission</emphasis> in the event of a 2-month period of symptom absence.</para>
      <para role="Para">
         MDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MDD</primary>
         </indexterm> can further be associated with <emphasis>mixed, melancholic,</emphasis> or <emphasis>atypical features</emphasis>; anxious distress; catatonia; peripartum occurrence (referred to as postpartum depression); mood-congruent or incongruent features; or seasonal onset (referred to as seasonal affective disorder) (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These specifiers allow for recognition of symptoms occurring on a continuum, situational onset, and allow for more detailed assessment of the additional symptoms (e. g., anxious distress can lead to further assessment of anxiety symptoms; Sachdev et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2015</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The prevalence rates of the features identified within these specifiers vary. Hasin et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>), for example, noted that the specifier for anxious/distressed was highest in their national sample, representing 74.6% of all those diagnosed with MDD, whereas the mixed features specifier was lower, characterizing 15.5% of those with MDD.</para>
      <para role="Para">According to the American Psychiatric Association (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>), the yearly prevalence of MDD is 7% and is highest among young adults and women, as typical onset occurs during puberty or adolescence. In a large US national study of MDD<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>MDD</primary>
         </indexterm>, yearly prevalence rates were found to be slightly higher at 10.4% and lifetime prevalence rates of MDD were as high as 20.6% (Hasin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Cross-cultural prevalence rates vary slightly. For example, a systematic review including 63 articles across 29 countries found that lifetime prevalence of MDD ranged from 2% to 21%, with lowest prevalence in Asia and the highest in Europe. They also demonstrated higher rates of MDD among females (vs. males) (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Within the United States, the chronicity of MDD also varies by ethnicity, such that prevalence rates were lower in African-Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic groups than within white Americans (Hasin et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Regarding the Hispanic or Latinx population, immigrants are less likely to experience depression than American-born Hispanic or Latinx individuals (Jackson-Triche et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2000</phrase>
         </emphasis>). However, it is important to note that symptoms of MDD may be underreported and under-detected in ethnic and racialized groups facing discrimination, and thus may be higher than what is noted in the literature (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>

         MDD<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> also differentially affects those within different settings. For example, relative to the general population, older adults living in nursing home or long-term care settings, patients in medical settings (especially those with chronic illness), and palliative care recipients are more likely to meet the criteria for MDD (Feliciano et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

            <phrase>2022</phrase>

PDD symptom criteria require at least a two-year duration of consistently low mood as well as two additional symptoms related to changes in appetite, sleep, self-esteem, ability to concentrate, energy level, or the experience of hopelessness (see Table <emphasis role="InternalRef">
            <phrase>6.1</phrase>
         </emphasis>). These symptoms cannot be absent for longer than 2 months throughout the depressive span, reflecting the chronicity of PDD. Further, during the period in which PDD occurs, it is possible for one to also meet the criteria for MDD (with persistent major depressive episode) (APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>

      <para role="Para">Like other mental disorders, the constellation of symptoms for PDD may not be the result of substances or physical or medical problems, be attributable to symptom profiles of other mental disorders (e. g., schizoaffective disorder), nor may there be evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes. The client must never have met symptom criteria for cyclothymic disorder, in which depressive and hypomanic episodes are present within a two-year period. Lastly, symptoms of PDD must cause personal distress or significantly affect one’s ability to function in important life arenas. Similar to MDD, PDD) can be qualified with specifiers, severity ratings, remission level, age of onset, and degree of presence of MDEs (e. g.,<emphasis>persistent, intermittent</emphasis>; APA, <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">PMDD must be differentiated from a common experience by menstruating women known as premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. Although both occur pre-menses, PMS is more commonly associated with behavioral and physical changes but not the affective symptoms required by PMDD. Moreover, symptoms of PMDD tend to be more severe than PMS (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">

Further, symptoms must continue past the typical end point of the effects (e. g., withdrawal) of the substance (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>

Clinicians should include a specifier regarding symptom onset (e. g.,<emphasis>during intoxication</emphasis> or <emphasis>withdrawal</emphasis>) and use the diagnostic code associated with the corresponding substance and the degree of substance use disorder (e. g.,<emphasis>mild, moderate, severe</emphasis>, or <emphasis>absent</emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Among individuals with substance use disorders, the lifetime prevalence rate of alcohol- and stimulant-induced depressive episodes was 40%, while the lifetime prevalence of substance−/medication-induced depressive disorders was 0.26% among those without a history of non-substance-induced depressive disorders<indexterm significance="normal">

Longitudinal research indicates that with many substances there is a bidirectional relationship between substance use and depression, such that use of the substance(s) leads to an increased risk for depression and the converse is also true. For example, substances like cannabis may increase the risk of developing a depressive disorder among adolescents and adults, particularly in heavy users or those with chronic use patterns (Langlois et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2021</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Similarly, depressive disorders increase the risk for the use of substances like cannabis, perhaps as a coping strategy for managing symptoms.</para>

Prevalence rates of cannabis-induced depressive disorders are less clear as much of the research reports rates of comorbid MDD in those who use cannabis and are noted to be higher than the general population (25%) or predict risk for future depression diagnosis (MDD or bipolar disorder diagnosis) (Botsford et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">

      <para role="Para">The risk for suicide differs depending on the type of substance used.

      <title>Other Specified Depressive Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder</title>
      <para role="Para">In earlier versions of the <emphasis>DSM</emphasis>, the Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified diagnosis was given when clinicians wanted to capture depressive conditions that did not meet the full criteria for any other depressive disorder or were provisional based on limited assessment information. In the <emphasis>DSM-5</emphasis>, this category was eliminated and replaced by two options: other specified depressive disorder<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>disorder</primary>
         </indexterm> and unspecified depressive disorder. The diagnoses of Other Specified Depressive Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder may be assigned when a client presents with depressive symptoms that are <emphasis>subclinical</emphasis>, that is the symptoms substantially affect functioning but full criteria for a depressive disorder are not present. The <emphasis>DSM-5</emphasis> describes three examples of conditions that would fit under this category including <emphasis>recurrent brief depression, short-duration depressive episode</emphasis>, and <emphasis>depressive episode with insufficient symptoms</emphasis>. Recurrent brief depression would refer to the presence of depressed mood and at least four of the eight additional depressive symptoms that are brief in nature (e. g., last 2–13 days) but recur over at least 1 year (i. e., 12 consecutive months). The person must experience distress or impairment in function. Short-duration depressive episode also refers to a condition in which there is a depressed mood and at least four additional symptoms; however, the symptoms and associated distress or impaired functioning only last for 4–13 days. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms refers to a situation in which a depressed mood is present and at least one additional depressive symptom with concomitant distress or impaired function for at least 14 days. In these examples, the person would not meet the criteria for any other depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorder during the specified timeframes.</para>
      <para role="Para">Unspecified Depressive Disorder is assigned if the clinician opts not to include information for why the depressive symptoms and associated distress or impairment do not meet the threshold for another more specific depressive disorder. This may occur in settings in which additional information necessary to make a more specific diagnosis is lacking as in the case of an emergency room (APA,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
