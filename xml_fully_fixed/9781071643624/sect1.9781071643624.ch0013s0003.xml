            <primary>suicide attempt</primary>
         </indexterm> by overdose after being raped by her boyfriend. She reported physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by her alcoholic father, verbal abuse by her mentally ill mother, and sexual abuse by an adult neighbor during childhood. After being removed from her parents’ home, Emma was placed in foster care, where some caregivers were abusive. Due to “treatment-resistant” depression and repeated suicide attempts, she had been hospitalized over ten times. Emma<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Emma</primary>
         </indexterm>demonstrated affective dysregulation with marked fluctuations in emotional states (e. g., anger giving way to tearful dysphoria, alternating with dissociative spells of looking “zoned out,” fear, and fleeting positive emotion). She was plagued with almost constant thoughts of suicide<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>suicide</primary>
         </indexterm> (with several life-threatening attempts) and occasional homicidal ideation toward her boyfriend. She had frequent nightmares that made her avoid sleep until the sun began to rise. Having been raped in bed as a child, she could<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>could</primary>
         </indexterm> sleep only on a couch. Emma distanced herself from emotions and memories of abuse through dissociation, avoidance behaviors, and focusing on her pressing health issues. She had few friends due to her conviction that others would “hate me if they knew me.” Emma also struggled with numerous medical problems including obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, lumbar disc disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, frequent headaches, and type II diabetes. Despite these daunting problems, Emma<indexterm significance="normal">

            <primary>and</primary>
         </indexterm> frequent depersonalization. She also noticed an increase in these symptoms when asking Emma about her past. Emma was then referred to a therapist trained in treating CT-based problems. The therapist gave Emma the DES-II and MID, which provided further clarification on the nature of her dissociative symptoms. The therapist focused on psychoeducation, safety planning, and teaching Emma techniques for healthy emotion regulation. Emma gradually felt supported, enabling her to end the relationship with her abusive boyfriend. As her avoidance decreased and her engagement in the world increased, she began to experience more intrusive recollections of abuse. The therapist taught her grounding and containment strategies to manage these symptoms. After she was able to better control her PTSD symptoms, she began doing phase 2 trauma-processing work, starting with discussing the episodes of abuse<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>abuse</primary>
         </indexterm>about which she had the least shame. Her PTSD and dissociative symptoms tended to temporarily escalate, followed by stabilization, although she had several relapses of self-harm. Following several years of trauma processing, Emma’s depression began to show significant improvement that endured for longer periods and she felt increasingly self-confident. She earned an associate’s degree and obtained a better job. For the first time in her life, she became romantically involved with someone who was relatively stable and supportive. While she continued to struggle with obesity and diabetes, her health improved. During the last stage of treatment, she focused on the functions of overeating (e. g., reducing feelings of vulnerability) and she<indexterm significance="normal">

         </indexterm> who presented for treatment because of concerns about his ability to manage his anger. Although he was hesitant to discuss his experiences at first, documents indicated a history of exposure to community violence, substance use (in utero exposure and early age of first use), and parents who were periodically incarcerated. As the oldest of four, Marques<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Marques</primary>
         </indexterm> became responsible for taking care of his siblings when his caregivers were not present. Although there were often family members who would help out, they engaged in physical and emotional abuse of all the children, often targeting one child and forcing the others to watch to ensure “they learned their lessons.” Marques frequently attempted to protect his siblings, which resulted in more severe<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>severe</primary>
         </indexterm> consequences for him, including a broken arm, concussion, and significant bruises throughout his adolescence. He learned early to use physical violence and verbal aggression to solve problems with peers, resulting in suspensions from school. He began smoking marijuana daily when he was 8 years old, drinking alcohol to the point of intoxication on a weekly basis by 10 years old, and he had tried nearly all other substances at least once prior to the age of 13. Upon entering treatment, he continued to smoke marijuana (&gt;1/8 ounce a day), drink on a daily basis (at least 13 oz. of hard liquor), and use methamphetamines (binge consumption pattern).</para>

One of his close friends overdosed, which motivated him to obtain treatment for his substance abuse.

At this point, the therapist administered the TSI-2 to<indexterm significance="normal">
