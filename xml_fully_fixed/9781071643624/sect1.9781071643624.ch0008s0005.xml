   <title>Case Illustrations</title>
   <para role="Para">Within this section, we present two cases to illustrate the assessment of depressive disorders. The first case represents a thorough, formal assessment of mood, medical, cognitive, and psychosocial history. This type of assessment is ideal, conducted in specialty behavioral health settings. The second case illustrates the shift toward brief collaborative care interventions delivered in primary care and other health and social service settings (Crowley et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>). In these settings, the emphasis is on rapid assessment of mood symptoms, collaborative treatment planning, and ongoing symptom monitoring and response.</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">The client was a 71-year-old, divorced, Hispanic-American woman who presented with complaints of lifetime depression. The intake assessment included assessment of her current and past history of psychiatric symptoms, alcohol and substance use, suicidal ideation and behaviors, and medical and treatment history using the SCID. The SCID was supplemented with a depression severity measure (HRSD) and a mental status exam. Because the client also endorsed some subjective memory complaints, the intake assessment also included a brief neuropsychological battery.</para>
   <para role="Para">At intake, careful attention was given to developing rapport and explaining the reason for assessment and for questions that were asked about her psychiatric and family history. The client reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of MDD, including depressed mood all day experienced daily, fatigue, and disrupted and restless sleep (occasional difficulties falling asleep but waking frequently and sometimes taking 1–3 h to fall back to sleep). She stated that she cried frequently, was lonely, and had few social supports. She reported being self-critical (about her weight and cleanliness/clutter of her home), feeling worthless and guilty over things that she had done or not done. She believed that she had brought the depression on herself and wondered why she didn’t take better care of herself. She also reported a loss of interest and pleasure in things that she used to enjoy and felt that she had to push herself to do anything, reporting “having nothing to look forward to.” She also reported feeling discouraged and pessimistic about the future (e. g., saw her future as “bleak”) and would probably have to continue working for “years to come.” When asked how she thinks things will work out, she stated that she will “probably be alone the rest of my life.” A review of her psychiatric history revealed that she had struggled with depression on and off for most of her life. Her medical history was notable for a total hip replacement and a left knee replacement several years prior, and her family history was unremarkable for psychiatric disorders.</para>
   <para role="Para">In addition to depressive symptoms, the client reported several psychosocial stressors including worry about finances, problems at work (conflict with supervisor), and worry about physical health. However, these did not appear to be excessive given her current financial situation (i. e., low income) and history of medical problems. She denied current suicidal ideation, hallucinations, and delusions. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.</para>
   <para role="Para">Her mental status exam was notable for psychomotor retardation, somewhat blunted affect, and negative thought. She described her mood as “sad” and was preoccupied with worry over cognitive complaints including difficulties concentrating at work, making decisions, and difficulty remembering medications and dates. She reported concerns about her finances and health. On exam, she also met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment.</para>
   <para role="Para">At the conclusion of the assessment, this client was diagnosed with<emphasis>major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate</emphasis>. In addition to depressive symptoms, she reported psychosocial stressors including worry about finances, problems at work (conflict with supervisor), and worry about physical health. Despite this report, her symptoms did not indicate a diagnosis of a comorbid anxiety disorder or anxious distress specifier, as her worry seemed commensurate to her situation, and she denied that the worry was causing distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning. Given her neuropsychological test results, the client also received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. The treatment plan focused on depressive symptoms and utilized problem-solving therapy techniques, which has empirical evidence for its value with older adults experiencing depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment (Kiosses &amp; Alexopoulos, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2014</phrase>
      </emphasis>).</para>
   <para role="Para">The case is illustrative of some of the issues related to working with a diverse older adult. For example, careful attention was given to the development of rapport and reducing stigma associated with reporting mental health symptoms. The interviewer was attentive to the client’s biopsychosocial concerns and took care to use the client’s preferred language for discussing depressive symptoms, in attempts to create an atmosphere of caring and comfort to assist the client with the assessment process.</para>
   <para role="Para FirstParaInFormalPara">The patient was a 56-year-old White woman who was screened as part of the primary care clinic’s routine screening procedures during a clinic visit for medical complaints. Screening included the PHQ-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7). Her scores indicated moderately severe depression and moderate anxiety symptoms. She denied suicidal ideation based on the last item of the PHQ-9. A brief psychosocial assessment was conducted, and she reported significant distress due to caring for her mother with Alzheimer’s disease<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Alzheimer’s disease</primary>
      </indexterm> and helping other family members (adult child, grandchildren), all of whom lived with her. In the absence of subjective memory complaints, no formal cognitive assessment was given. The intervention was guided by a brief version of behavioral activation for depression (Gum et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2016</phrase>
      </emphasis>), with a flexible number of sessions and follow-up telephone calls based on how well she engaged in behavioral goals she set and her PHQ-9 scores. To assess treatment response, the PHQ-9 was administered during each encounter and discussed with her. She initially had difficulty completing behavioral goals she set for herself, but with attention to barriers and problem-solving efforts, she gradually began to complete more goals between encounters. The PHQ-9 improved to the non-depressed range by the last encounter.</para>
   <para role="Para">This case is an example of using brief screening tools to identify patients in distress, develop collaborative treatment plans with the patient, and monitor treatment response over time. There was less attention given to formal diagnosis. If the patient had not shown improvement, then referral to a specialty behavioral health setting would have been warranted, where more thorough formal assessment and interventions would have been provided.</para>
