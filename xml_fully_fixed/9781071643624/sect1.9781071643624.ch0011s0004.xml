   <title>Case Illustration</title>
   <para role="Para">The following case illustration shows an example of a hypothetical unstructured clinical interview of a clinician meeting with a patient for the first time. The patient is a woman presenting with harm-related OCD<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>OCD</primary>
      </indexterm>. The interview highlights how to assess the presence and severity of OCD, help a patient feel comfortable disclosing behaviors/thoughts that they perceive as odd or embarrassing, and gather information to distinguish between different diagnoses.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: What brings you in today?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: I have been really keyed up lately, especially at night before I go to bed. I have so many thoughts and I can’t stop them or get them out of my head.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: That sounds challenging. Can you tell me a bit more about these thoughts?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: I just worry a lot about my family. These worries run through my mind throughout the day, but they get much worse before I go to bed, and it’s getting in the way of my sleep.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: Concern for family members can be extremely upsetting. What do you worry about related to your family?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: The worries don’t really make sense. I’m actually a little hesitant to tell you about them because I don’t want you to think I’m crazy.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: I understand how hard it can be to talk about these distressing thoughts, especially with someone you just met. I want to assure you that I have worked with many patients with anxiety, and there are no thoughts that can surprise or shock me. Everyone has odd thoughts from time to time, and that doesn’t mean you’re crazy. Learning more about your specific thoughts will help us develop the most effective treatment plan for you.</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Thanks for letting me know<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>know</primary>
      </indexterm> that, but it’s not just the thoughts that I’m anxious to tell you about. There are things I do throughout the day because of these thoughts that are not normal, and I don’t know anyone else who does them. Sometimes my family gets annoyed at me for it, too.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: Do you do these things throughout the day to help get rid of your anxiety related to the thought?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Yes, but it only helps for a little bit and then the thought comes up again.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: What’s an example of one of these behaviors?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Before I go to bed, I check to make sure the stove is shut off and all the doors in the house are locked, but I don’t just do it once. I’ll check each stove and lock at least four to five times, sometimes even more. Sometimes I spend almost a half hour repeating these checks, and on most nights, I get out of bed multiple times to check again.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: What are you worried will happen if you don’t do these checks?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: I fear that someone will come into my house and take my children. I check to make sure the back door next to my children’s bedrooms is locked the most. I also worry that it will be my fault that there is a house fire.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: You mentioned these thoughts come up all the time. Do you always check the locks and the stove when these thoughts come up?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Most of the time! But when I can’t do the check, I will have my husband check for me. Like when I was in the clinic waiting room just earlier, I called my husband and asked him to check to make sure I shut the stove off before I left this morning. He gets mad at me because I ask him to do this almost every day.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: I see… that sounds very time-consuming and stressful to feel the need to do these checks all the time. When you have unwanted and upsetting thoughts about bad things happening to your family, you engage in checking behaviors, which give you temporary relief, only for those thoughts and urges to come right back again. These symptoms you’re describing are very similar to experiences of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Have you heard of obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Yes, I’ve heard of OCD, but I thought people with OCD usually wash their hands a lot and are scared of germs. I’m not like that at all.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: You’re right–people with OCD can have fears related to germs, but the disorder is actually much more than that. People with OCD can present with many different thoughts and behaviors. Would it be okay if I told you a bit more about OCD and some other common symptoms that are related to the disorder?</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan: Sure.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinician: Great, I have a list of common thoughts that sometimes come up for people with OCD. Let me know if you ever have these thoughts.</para>
   <para role="Para">Next, the clinician briefly provides psychoeducation on obsessions and compulsions and could administer the Y-BOCS symptom<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>symptom</primary>
      </indexterm> checklist to identify any other OCD symptoms that Susan experiences. At the beginning of an unstructured clinical interview, the patient is typically asked a broad question about their presenting concern. To determine if a patient has OCD, a clinician should focus on asking questions that can help clarify whether the content of the thoughts and purpose of the behaviors are characteristics of obsessions/compulsions or related to other similar diagnoses, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), negative thinking common in depressive disorders, or behaviors associated with other OC-related disorders like trichotillomania and skin picking.</para>
   <para role="Para">Susan initially reported that she worries a lot about her family during the day, which could be a symptom of several different disorders. The clinician probed about the thought content, but Susan was hesitant to tell them about her thoughts because she feared the clinician would think<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>think</primary>
      </indexterm> she is “crazy.” It is common for individuals with OCD to worry that others will think they’re “crazy” or “weird” because of the content of their intrusive thoughts. The clinician normalized these concerns for the patient, which also led her to disclose that she is embarrassed by the behaviors she engages in to reduce her fears related to the thoughts. This was the first indication that these thoughts and behaviors may be OCD symptoms.</para>
   <para role="Para">It is also helpful to point out to patients that all people have intrusive thoughts from time to time to again help normalize these unwanted, distressing thoughts. Additionally, using the Y-BOCS symptom checklist can give the clinician a clearer diagnostic picture of symptoms that the patient may not realize are related to OCD<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>OCD</primary>
      </indexterm>. Using this assessment can also show the patient that she is not the only person with these thoughts/behaviors. Further, Susan told the clinician that she frequently seeks reassurance from her husband about the stove. There are probably many other ways Susan seeks reassurance from her husband and other people, and the clinician should specifically ask questions about this during the clinical interview.</para>
