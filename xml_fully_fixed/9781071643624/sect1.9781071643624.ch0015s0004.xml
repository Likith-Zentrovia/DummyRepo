      <para role="Para">--</para>
      <para role="Para">The therapist used several more strategies to ask about the binge-eating episodes. You can see the level of detail the therapist asked for in detailing the foods consumed. A useful guideline is to get enough detail that you could go to the store (or restaurant) and recreate the exact meal or snack. With some patients, using a portion or measurement guide may be helpful (i. e., helping them to describe their eating episodes<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>episodes</primary>
         </indexterm> with descriptors like cups, teaspoons<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>teaspoons</primary>
         </indexterm>, and ounces or indicate portion sizes using their hands). The reason for obtaining such detailed information on eating episodes is because the size of the episode (small or typical meal or snack vs. an amount that is definitely large) determines whether the person should be diagnosed with purging disorder, compensatory eating disorder, BN, or BED.</para>
      <para role="Para">Another helpful strategy is to use the phrase, “What else?” in asking about foods consumed in the binge-eating episode. This phrasing tells the patient that you expect there to be more foods consumed, as opposed to the phrasing, “Anything else?” which can suggest to the client that the amount of food he or she has described is already large enough. In this dialogue, the therapist asked, “What else?” until the patient reported being finished describing the eating episode. The therapist provided positive<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>positive</primary>
         </indexterm>reinforcement (praise) to the patient for discussing the binge-eating episodes and reiterated<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>reiterated</primary>
         </indexterm>the rationale for why this information was sought.</para>

         <emphasis>Will:</emphasis> I guess so, because I had planned it out. I’ve just been overeating like this for so long that I’m kind of numb to it now. It’s just something I plan to do. When it first started, it felt way more out-of-control. Now I just plan<indexterm significance="normal">

      <para role="Para">The therapist asked about LOC<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>LOC</primary>
         </indexterm>and the patient denied having that experience during his recent binge-eating episodes. The therapist then asked follow-up questions to inquire about LOC in different ways that might resonate with the patient (e. g., feeling like he couldn’t stop eating once he had started and feeling it was inevitable that he would eat that amount of food). Each of these strategies was used to assess LOC, which the patient eventually endorsed. In our experience, sometimes the sense of being out-of-control over binge-eating episodes may diminish over the course of the ED illness (e. g., the client eventually plans to have a binge-eating episode each Friday night, so the planned episode does not feel as out-of-control). In situations in which it is unclear whether the client experienced LOC, it can help to ask open-ended questions to elicit their thoughts and feelings during the eating<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>eating</primary>
         </indexterm>episode. The take-home message is that even if LOC is mild, it is still considered present.</para>

      <para role="Para">The therapist used<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>used</primary>
         </indexterm>several strategies to fully assess the patient’s exercise behaviors. The patient initially mentioned that her exercise was about health and that she exercised frequently for her job, but not to influence body shape or weight. Because exercise can be a healthful behavior for many people, patients with EDs will sometimes frame their exercise in a positive manner. The therapist, however, should continue to ask about the patient’s exercise pattern in a nonjudgmental manner to better understand how the ED and exercise might be related. The therapist in this case validated what the patient was saying and asked whether there was any added benefit that her shape and/or weight could be influenced by her exercise behaviors. The patient<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>patient</primary>
         </indexterm>also framed her exercise as being necessary for work, so the therapist asked detailed questions about how much effort the patient put into exercise (e. g., more than other instructors) as well as the frequency of exercise (i. e., including additional workouts in addition to teaching exercise classes as part of her job). The therapist also asked about perceived exertion to evaluate intensity (e. g., how hard was Betsy pushing herself during the activity).Assessing<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>Assessing</primary>
         </indexterm> perceived exertion is another way to help determine if the exercise was potentially unhealthy. It is also important to inquire about days when exercise persisted despite an injury or illness or when against medical advice. For example, in this vignette, Betsy exercised at almost her maximum intensity, even when she was sick or injured, which revealed she exercised in a rigid way despite her doctor’s orders to rest. Finally, Betsy volunteered that she exercised to compensate for an overeating episode. If she had not volunteered this information, it would have<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>have</primary>
         </indexterm> been important for the clinician to ask if exercise was used to<indexterm significance="normal">
