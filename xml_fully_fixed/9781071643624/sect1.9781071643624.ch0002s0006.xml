   <title>Issues Specific to Emerging Professionals</title>
   <para role="Para">The process of learning how to conduct an effective and thorough clinical interview can be exciting but also anxiety provoking. Many emerging professionals feel overwhelmed by the task and lack confidence in their knowledge and skills. Conducting an effective interview is a skill that can only be developed over time and with experience. As such, mistakes and missteps are going to happen. In fact, struggling with one’s first several interviews is to be expected and therefore should not be a source of undue anxiety for the emerging professional. Common issues specific to emerging professionals in the context of clinical interviewing include managing anxiety, obtaining the appropriate breadth and depth of information, overlooking the process (i. e., the interaction between client and clinician) of the interview, premature advice-giving, having concerns about interacting with clients from diverse backgrounds, and managing personal questions.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clients can often sense a clinician’s anxiety or discomfort; therefore, it is essential for emerging professionals to learn to manage their nervousness during interviews. Frequently, clients are anxious at the interview as well and might not know what to expect, depending on whether or not they have had previous experience with psychotherapy. It can be helpful to ease into the initial interview by engaging the client in brief discussions of “lighter” topics (for example: “Tell me a little bit about where you are from or where you grew up”) before delving into the client’s significant concerns. Emerging professionals can reduce their own anxiety regarding interviews by activities such as observing more experienced clinicians conduct interviews, practicing mock diagnostic interviews with peers, and reviewing ahead of time any information gathered about the client and the client’s pressing concerns. In addition, the beginning of one’s career is an opportune time to learn to engage in adequate self-care. Regular exercise, a sufficient amount of sleep, and use of relaxation exercises and meditation are all ways of maintaining an overall sense of well-being and control, which will likely have a positive impact on one’s level of professional confidence.</para>
   <para role="Para">Emerging professionals tend to worry about getting “all” of the necessary information in the initial interview and struggle with asking too many superfluous questions (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1998</phrase>
      </emphasis>). This can make the interview feel like an interrogation rather than a conversation between the clinician and client. However, in a sense, the entire course of psychotherapy with a client can be thought of as an ongoing “information-gathering” process. Indeed, clinicians continue to learn more about the client as psychotherapy progresses. As such, although it is important to obtain as much relevant information as possible, getting all of the information in one or two interviews is not necessarily a requirement.</para>
   <para role="Para">Conversely, emerging professionals may struggle with not exploring sensitive areas out of the belief that it is impolite to explore certain aspects of clients’ lives (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1998</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Avoidance of socially sensitive topics has the potential for communicating to the client that certain areas are “off-limits” and should not be explored in psychotherapy. For example, young clinicians may be hesitant to discuss sexuality with an older client, even when it is central to the presenting problem. In addition, avoiding sensitive topics in an interview could be life-threatening if a client has suicidal or homicidal ideation or is dealing with domestic violence or substance abuse. Clinicians who are anxious or hesitant to explore certain topics with their clients should certainly discuss their fears with a trusted supervisor or colleague.</para>
   <para role="Para">Some emerging professionals focus so much on the<emphasis>content</emphasis> of the interview that they end up overlooking the <emphasis>process</emphasis> of the interview. Many clinics use interview outlines or checklists to assist emerging professionals with obtaining relevant information. However, this can lead to an excessive amount of note-taking in an attempt to make sure every blank on the intake form is filled in. This may give the impression to clients that the clinician is more interested in filling out paperwork than getting to know them as individuals, which can negatively impact the development of rapport, as noted earlier. In most training settings, interviews and therapy sessions are recorded for the purpose of supervision. An advantage is that clinicians can use those recordings to document vital information that might have been overlooked. Emerging professionals may become frustrated if there are significant gaps in the information obtained during an initial interview, in spite of repeated attempts to get pertinent answers. Difficulty with obtaining information from a client is often important diagnostically. For example, it could reflect the client’s ambivalence about psychotherapy, personality style, cognitive impairment, or a poor therapeutic alliance. It is often useful to address this difficulty directly by checking in with clients about how they are feeling about the interview, about the clinician, and about disclosing personal information.</para>
   <para role="Para">Many emerging professionals struggle with the impulse to “fix” the client. At times, it may be necessary to take action during an interview, for example, to ensure the safety of a suicidal client or assist a low-income client with obtaining financial assistance for basic needs such as food or electricity. However, advice-giving often evolves from the interviewer’s experiences and perspective, rather than the client’s (Faust,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1998</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Some clinicians feel a sense of pressure to “do something” to demonstrate their competence to a client early in the interview or treatment process and may be tempted to offer simple advice. We encourage clinicians to resist this temptation and discuss the temptation in supervision. Often clients enter psychotherapy only when they have tried every other solution to address their problems and none of those solutions has been effective. It is likely that the clinician who gives advice without adequate exploration will make suggestions that have already been tried, adding to a sense of hopelessness and frustration on the part of the client and undermining the client’s confidence in the clinician’s abilities. Simple solutions for complex problems simply do not work. Emerging clinicians can assure themselves that providing empathic listening and emotional support for the client are active strategies that are known to be beneficial.</para>
   <para role="Para">Some emerging professionals are uncomfortable interacting with clients whose backgrounds and identities are much different than those of the clinician. Consultations with supervisors and peers who are more knowledgeable about issues of diversity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>diversity</primary>
      </indexterm> as well as attending workshops and other educational programs can better equip clinicians to work with diverse populations. In addition, as noted earlier, clinicians should strive to be aware of their own biases and stereotypes to ensure they are not impacting the interview process or impairing the therapeutic relationship. Clinical supervision and the clinician’s personal psychotherapy are appropriate environments in which to explore one’s own biases, stereotypes, and areas of discomfort. Clinicians should be willing to do extra research after meeting with a new client if there is a knowledge deficit in a particular area. If a clinician ultimately determines that he or she is not competent to work with a specific client, that client should be referred to another clinician with greater expertise.</para>
   <para role="Para">Dealing with personal questions such as the clinician’s age, ethnic background, marital status, or whether or not the clinician has children can be especially difficult for emerging professionals. There are several reasons for why a client might ask a clinician a personal question. Sometimes clients who ask personal questions are looking for a way to “bond” or become more comfortable with the clinician by seeking common ground, for instance, by asking where the clinician grew up. Alternatively, clients may be unaware of the unique nature of clinician–client relationships and how this professional relationship is different from social relationships with family or friends. Other times, clients are unsure whether the clinician has the expertise or life experience to adequately understand their struggles and to assist them with finding solutions to those struggles. For example, an older client might ask about the clinician’s age because the clinician seems “too young” to be helpful. As we noted earlier, answering these types of factual questions in a non-defensive way that reassures the client of one’s professional competence can lessen the client’s concerns. It may also be useful to discuss with the client the reason behind the question. Indeed, sensitively exploring the client’s concerns can facilitate the therapeutic alliance and prevent unintentional ruptures.</para>
