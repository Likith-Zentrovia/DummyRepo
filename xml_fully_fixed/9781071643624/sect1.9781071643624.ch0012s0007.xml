   <title>Dos and Don’ts</title>
   <para role="Para">DO develop a therapeutic alliance, a relationship built on trust and safety that is used for the client’s benefit. The clinician’s efforts to build that relationship should take place during the first session and continue throughout treatment. While building rapport is a long-term process, its benefits can be immediately demonstrated by the client’s ability to honestly and openly disclose information, collaborate, give their best effort in completing assessments, and engage in treatment.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO set aside an appropriate amount of time for giving an unstructured and (semi)structured interview before administering assessments, making a diagnosis, and proceeding with treatment. During the interview, conduct an informal mini mental status exam by being attuned to verbal descriptions, non-verbal body and facial expressions, motor activity, affect, and level of collaboration.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO explain the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment process to the client before you begin therapy. Providing informed consent at the start of therapy can help alleviate the client’s fears by addressing concerns and setting expectations<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>expectations</primary>
      </indexterm>. It is also essential to “check in” with the client throughout the intake and diagnosis process to see if they have questions or clarification.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO explore cultural considerations by reading relevant research and by consulting with experienced clinicians. Be aware of culturally prescribed “idioms of distress” (e. g., somatization and under or overreporting of symptoms), as well as your cultural bias and how it could impact the therapeutic process.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO use structured interviews, standardized assessments, self-report measurements, and evidence-based treatments throughout therapy. Scientifically supported assessments and therapies have shown high success rates (Norcross &amp; Wampold,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2011</phrase>
      </emphasis>). A description of evidence-based therapies for DSM-5 disorders can be found on the American Psychological Association’s Division 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology) website.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO inquire about past and present substance use as research shows very high comorbidity between PTSD and substance abuse. When inquiring about substance use, it is useful to learn about the type, frequency, amount, and duration of substance(s) used.</para>
   <para role="Para">DO always inquire about past and present suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan, or intent, as research shows a significant positive correlation between PTSD<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>PTSD</primary>
      </indexterm> symptoms and suicide (Boscarino, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2008</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Prigerson et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2002</phrase>
      </emphasis>; Sareen et al., <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2007</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Should the client endorse suicidal ideation, proceed by exploring whether such ideation is passive (e. g., wishing to disappear) or active (e. g., “I want to kill myself”). If active ideation is present, ask if there is a specific plan in place (e. g., use of a gun, medication overdose) and the seriousness and lethality of the intention (e. g., highly unlikely to highly likely). As appropriate, collaboratively develop a plan for the client to remain safe (i. e., a suicide safety plan). Consult with an experienced colleague regarding your risk assessment and the safety plan’s adequacy. If needed, discuss hospitalization.</para>
   <para role="Para">DON’T rush the client into revealing the details of their trauma during the initial stages of therapy. While a diagnosis of PTSD or ASD requires that specific factors about a traumatic event are established for meeting Criterion A, consider discussing the traumatic event but be attuned to the dynamics in the room. Does the client independently and voluntarily share any of the details about their traumatic event? If not, it may be preferable to obtain the necessary details once treatment commences, when the therapeutic alliance is better established.</para>
   <para role="Para">DON’T assume that exposure to a traumatic event always results in PTSD. Remember that most of the population is exposed to some type of trauma but most do not develop PTSD. In addition, consider whether Prolonged Grief Disorder could better explain the symptoms than PTSD in relevant situations. Such consideration is essential because it may impact the type of therapy you use with the client.</para>
   <para role="Para">DON’T avoid making a comorbid diagnosis when warranted. Because of the high prevalence of PTSD with mood disorders, it is essential to ascertain if the client has symptoms of a mood disorder. If yes, it is important to identify the severity of the symptoms using appropriately normed, evidence-based assessments<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>assessments</primary>
      </indexterm>. The diagnosis would inform case conceptualization and influence the type of therapy selected.</para>
   <para role="Para">DON’T follow pseudo-science or use non-substantiated techniques when treating PTSD. Use a well-established evidence-based treatment such as Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PET), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Read about each modality and use the best one for your client.</para>
