   <title>Diversity and the Interviewing Process</title>
   <para role="Para">Culture refers to a common sense of beliefs, norms, and values among a group of people. Culture impacts the ways in which mental health and illness are perceived, whether individuals seek help, the coping strategies they employ, and the attitudes of the consumer as well as the practitioners and mental health systems (Gopalkrishnan,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2018</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Key purposes of the diagnostic interview are to establish a therapeutic alliance with the client and to begin to formulate a clinical diagnosis. Failing to consider issues of diversity<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>diversity</primary>
      </indexterm> can negatively impact both the relationship and the diagnosis, which can ultimately reduce the effectiveness of treatment. Diversity, as it is discussed here, includes all aspects of cultural identity such as age, gender, geographic location, physical ability, race and ethnicity, religious preference, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status, among others. Consideration of multicultural issues is particularly important given the increasing diversity of the US and the likelihood of clinicians encountering clients from cultural backgrounds different from their own, sometimes markedly so.</para>
   <para role="Para">Three major domains of multicultural competence are (1) awareness of one’s own assumptions, values, and biases, (2) understanding the worldview of culturally diverse clients, and (3) knowledge of culturally appropriate intervention strategies and techniques (Sue et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2022</phrase>
      </emphasis>). Culturally sensitive and competent clinicians intentionally work to understand the worldview of others without negative judgments. Social justice should also always be a prominent feature of multicultural counseling competencies such that clinicians must understand ecological factors that influence clients and also possess the skills to challenge systemic barriers that may impede growth to enhanced well-being. Next, we briefly touch upon each of these domains with the caveat that this section provides a general overview of the issues and therefore is not intended to provide the necessary background material for clinicians to adequately assess clients from different cultural groups. Recommendations for additional reading are provided at the end.</para>

      <title>Impact of Diversity on the Therapeutic Relationship</title>
      <para role="Para">As we have highlighted earlier, a good working alliance is crucial for psychotherapy to be effective. Particularly during the first few sessions, clinicians must create good rapport and establish their credibility in a way that is sensitive. Cultural competency is key in building strong, positive relationships with clients of diverse backgrounds. Becoming culturally competent requires clinicians to engage in self-reflective work to become aware of their own cultural identity and its impact on their views of the self, others, and the world, which affects clinical perception and judgment (Sayegh et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2023</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Among refugee populations and other minority groups who have experienced significant oppression, trust may not be as easily established as with clients who are not minoritized (Chung &amp; Bemak,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For example, Dana (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2002</phrase>
         </emphasis>) describes a process by which African American clients may “size up” a mental health clinician and suggests that African Americans look for signs of genuineness, authenticity, and approachability in mental health clinicians. It is often necessary to spend time during the clinical and diagnostic interview to discuss, define, and clarify roles of the client and psychologist and to explore the client’s expectations regarding psychotherapy; this may be especially true for clients from non-Western cultures, where personal problems are not usually shared with people outside the family network (Chung &amp; Bemak, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). For instance, different meanings for the term <emphasis>clinician</emphasis> can be found across different cultural groups, ranging from physician, to medicine man/woman, to folk healer (Paniagua, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Moreover, in some cultures,confidentiality<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>confidentiality</primary>
         </indexterm> may mean that family members or close friends may have access to the client’s personal information, so it is important for the clinician to ensure a workable definition that the client feels comfortable with and agrees upon (Chung &amp; Bemak, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Individuals from more collectivistic cultures may also experience confusion about the “distance” or “coolness” of the Western counselor who defines the social and professional relationship more narrowly and refuses social invitations to family events (Chung &amp; Bemak, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Many traditional psychotherapeutic interventions are bound by the Western cultural norms and practices with which they were created. The culturally competent clinician is able to adapt, alter, and modify these techniques to meet the needs of the diverse client. Sue et al. (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) thoughtfully describe several culture-bound values of psychology including: focus on the individual; preference for verbal, emotional, behavioral expressiveness; insight; self-disclosure; scientific empiricism; distinctions between mental and physical functioning; ambiguity; and patterns of communication. Nonverbal communication, such as bodily movements (e. g., eye contact, facial expression, posture), the use and perception of personal and interpersonal space, and vocal cues (e. g., loudness of voice, pauses, rate, inflection), varies depending on cultural factors (Sue et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Clinicians should be aware of their own communication style and anticipate how it may affect clients with a different communication style. To facilitate rapport with clients of a different culture, it may be helpful for clinicians to match the client’s rhythm and pace of speech, maximize awareness of their comfort level with eye contact and physical distance, show respect for hierarchy in the family and extended family, and use appropriate metaphors and symbols. Of course, this is easier said than done, so mindful attention to these issues is paramount.</para>
      <para role="Para">Adjustments can be made to the interview that may help to increase the comfort level of diverse clients and serve to strengthen the therapeutic relationship. For example, clients with low vision may require large print informed consent forms and questionnaires. Alternatively, the clinician could offer to read printed materials aloud. Hearing amplifiers can be offered to those clients with mild or moderate hearing loss. Translators or interpreters may be used when the clinician and client do not share the same language, although such practice is not without notable complications. Paniagua (<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>) cautions that the use of translators introduces a third person into the psychotherapeutic process, which can lead to miscommunications or misunderstandings. The use of a translator may also be perceived negatively by some clients, who would prefer to speak to a clinician who understands their language. If translators must be used, and no better options exist, then professional translators should have formal training in mental health and culture-related syndromes and also share a similar level of acculturation as the client. Due to possible privacy and confidentiality<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>confidentiality</primary>
         </indexterm> concerns, use of a client’s relative or friend as a translator for psychotherapy is cautioned and should be considered and discussed within the client’s definitions of these concepts (Paniagua, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Modifications to the diagnostic interview may also include clinicians being more flexible in their role and shifting the traditional boundaries of “clinician.” For example, for a client who has difficulty getting to the mental health clinic because of lack of transportation, the clinician may conduct the interview outside of the office, such as in the client’s home or another private location. Having a more active style of offering concrete assistance may be necessary, such as providing information on obtaining social services if the client needs them. Consulting family members and paraprofessionals or folk healers may be appropriate in some cases in order to better understand the struggles and sources of resilience of culturally diverse clients (Paniagua,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Talk therapies may not be the most useful form of therapy for some cultural groups (Gopalkrishnan, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In cases where traditional talk therapy may not be the natural means of resolving problems, culturally competent clinicians will be open to incorporating alternative techniques that resonate within a client’s culture (Chung &amp; Bemak, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Possible alternatives include movement-based therapies, expressive therapies, or online therapies (Gopalkrishnan, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2018</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>

      <title>Impact of Diversity on Clinical Diagnosis</title>
      <para role="Para">Clinicians must be sensitive to cultural issues not only to more effectively establish a therapeutic relationship but also because of the impact of diversity<indexterm significance="normal">
            <primary>diversity</primary>
         </indexterm> on clinical diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is essential, as it facilitates communication, dictates the nature of treatment, and provides an indication of the likely prognosis and course of the disorder (Segal &amp; Coolidge, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2001</phrase>
         </emphasis>). During the clinical interview, clinicians use the client’s description of the frequency, intensity, and duration of the symptoms; signs from a mental status examination; and the clinician’s own observations and judgment of the client’s behavior to determine a formal diagnosis of a mental disorder. The final diagnosis depends on the clinician’s belief about whether the client’s signs, symptom patterns, and impairment of functioning meet criteria for a given diagnosis, as set forth by the <emphasis>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition</emphasis> (DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Culture is involved in conceptualizations of what is considered normal versus abnormal, and it influences the expression and course of mental disorders (Gureje et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2020</phrase>
         </emphasis>). As such, it is an important factor to take into account when formulating a diagnosis. Culture can account for variation in the ways in which clients communicate their symptoms, which symptoms they report, and the meanings they attach to the mental disorder. Clinicians who are unfamiliar with a client’s frame of reference may incorrectly see something as psychopathological when they are actually seeing variations in behaviors, beliefs, or experiences that are particular to and normative within the client’s culture. For example, speaking in tongues, hearing the voice of God, or witnessing spiritual beings should probably not be considered pathological for individuals from certain religious communities, whereas it may be considered a problem from someone who is nonreligious (Johnson &amp; Friedman, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2008</phrase>
         </emphasis>). Without cultural awareness, the clinician may use their own cultural experience as a template to assess the client’s clinical presentation, without realizing that this biases their definitions of normal and abnormal behavior (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The use of structured and semi-structured interviews can reduce clinician bias with regard to diagnosis because structured and semi-structured interviews provide a standardized way to thoroughly assess all the diagnostic criteria for all of the major mental disorders in the DSM system (Segal &amp; Williams, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2014</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">The DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>) provides an outline designed to assist clinicians with developing a culturally appropriate clinical formulation. Clinicians are encouraged to explore and provide a narrative summary for each of five categories (see Table <emphasis role="InternalRef">
            <phrase>1.3</phrase>
         </emphasis>). The DSM-5-TR also includes the Cultural Formation Interview (CFI), a 16-item assessment tool that may be used to gain information about the impact of culture on an individual’s presentation and care plan. Developed as a brief semi-structured interview, it emphasizes four domains of assessment: Cultural Definition of the Problem; Cultural Perceptions of Cause, Context, and Support; Cultural Factors Affecting Self-Coping and Past Help Seeking; and Cultural Factors Affecting Current Help Seeking. Clinicians should become familiar with the Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress in the DSM-5-TR, which provides information on several culture-specific conditions (e. g., Attaque de nervios, Dhat syndrome, and Taijin kyofusho) that may or may not be linked to a specific diagnostic category. The Patient Cultural Identity Assessment, Therapist Cultural Self-Assessment Worksheet, and the Intersectionality and Diagnosis Worksheet created by Dadlani and colleagues are additional resources that may be helpful for clinicians to assess and integrate culture in clinical assessment (Dadlani et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2012</phrase>
         </emphasis>).</para>
      <para role="Para">Appraisal of the client’s cultural background should be a standard part of any clinical or diagnostic interview, but clinicians should be wary of overgeneralizing and stereotyping (Sue et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
            <phrase>2022</phrase>
         </emphasis>). In addition, because each person has multiple identity dimensions, clinicians should be cognizant of the many within-group differences that can exist between members of a cultural group, which can sometimes outnumber the between-group differences. For example, differences between individuals considered to be in the same racial or ethnic group can be due to any number of factors, such as varying national origin, socioeconomic class, level of acculturation, age, or gender, to name a few. Moreover, clinicians should not automatically assume that the problems of culturally diverse clients are necessarily related to cultural experiences or background. For example, it would be erroneous to assume that an 85-year-old client is depressed because of age alone.</para>
