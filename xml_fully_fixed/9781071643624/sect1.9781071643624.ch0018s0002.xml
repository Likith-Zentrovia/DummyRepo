   <title>Procedures for Gathering Information</title>
   <para role="Para">Many factors<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>factors</primary>
      </indexterm> are important to consider during the information-gathering phase of making a diagnosis of personality disorder. First and foremost, building<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>building</primary>
      </indexterm>rapport is essential. Rapport may be easily developed in the first session with some clients while others may need many sessions before rapport can be established. This is especially true for individuals with PDs. Individuals with PDs, depending on their diagnosis, may be particularly hesitant (avoidant PD) or suspicious (paranoid or schizotypal PDs) of new relationships or may be particularly vulnerable to feeling misunderstood or not heard (borderline PD). Rapport also can be easily damaged by not attending to client concerns. Focusing too closely on a strict protocol of questions in a structured interview without care for building a relationship with the client may damage rapport if the client believes that the clinician’s agenda is more important than their feelings<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>feelings</primary>
      </indexterm> and experience. Empathetic and validating responses to the client’s feelings, experiences, and behaviors are essential to maintain necessary rapport. Rapport also may be damaged if the pacing of questions in a protocol does not match the client’s comfort level. Therefore, clinicians must allow sufficient time for trust<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>trust</primary>
      </indexterm> between clinician and client to develop. Additionally, the level of rapport is ever-changing, and therefore rapport must be assessed consistently, across and within sessions. When a rupture in rapport occurs, this should be addressed as a top priority.</para>
   <para role="Para">When assessing PDs, it is essential to take a full history covering the individual’s whole life paying particular attention<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>attention</primary>
      </indexterm> to developmental history and early adversity and trauma as these are key etiologic factors for PDs. As noted above, PDs are broad, enduring, and dysfunctional; therefore, it is important to look for patterns that date back to late adolescence or early adulthood (if not earlier as in the case of antisocial PD). Additionally, in order to make a PD diagnosis it is essential to ensure that the maladaptive cognitions, feelings, and behaviors are consistent across contexts and not limited to certain situations or environments.</para>
   <para role="Para">There are multiple methods<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>methods</primary>
      </indexterm>of assessing PDs including clinical interviews (unstructured or semi-structured), self-reports, and informant reports. Ultimately,<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Ultimately,</primary>
      </indexterm> each method has strengths and weaknesses and the best diagnostic assessment will make use of multiple methods. Self-report measures offer many benefits and can be complimentary when used as a way of first identifying which PDs should be emphasized during the interview and which disorders could be ignored with minimal risk (Widiger &amp; Samuel, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2005</phrase>
      </emphasis>). This way of narrowing down what PDs should be the focus of the interview can help with time efficiency as well as with maintaining rapport as clients may become frustrated if asked many questions in a semi-structured interview that are not relevant to them. An additional benefit is that self-report inventories can alert the clinician to PDs that might have otherwise been missed as a result of false expectations<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>expectations</primary>
      </indexterm>, bias, or assumptions (e. g., failing to notice histrionic PD traits in male patients). Self-reports pose a risk of possible false-negatives due to denial or inadequate insight on the part of the client. However, many self-report inventories include validity scales that can signal the presence of response biases and distortions (i. e., malingering or inaccurate reporting of symptoms) that might invalidate the diagnostic assessment.Although<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>Although</primary>
      </indexterm>brief screening questionnaires can be used to determine what PDs to focus on when conducting a more in-depth interview, these do not provide a comprehensive assessment and typically lack validity scales.</para>
   <para role="Para">Clinical interviews allow clinicians to ensure diagnostic criteria are fully met. For example, a clinician in an interview can ensure a client who endorses on a self-report “many mood shifts per day” truly meets<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>meets</primary>
      </indexterm> the BPD criterion for unstable affect due to emotional hypersensitivity rather than merely experiencing normative affective experiences throughout the day. Relying on unstructured interviews can cause clinicians to fail to consider all of the necessary criteria necessary to make a diagnosis or lead to clinicians falling prey to confirmation bias. For these reasons, semi-structured interviews are the preferred method of assessment. Semi-structured interviews ensure and provide documentation that each PD diagnostic criterion has been systematically, objectively<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>objectively</primary>
      </indexterm>, and comprehensively assessed. This also aids in the likelihood that assessments<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>assessments</primary>
      </indexterm>will be consistent across interviewers.</para>
   <para role="Para">Informant-report inventories also provide useful information in the assessment of PDs given individuals with PDs may lack insight into their own dysfunctional personality patterns. Agreement between self-descriptions and peer-descriptions of personality traits has generally been good to excellent when sampling within nonclinical populations (Mc Crae et al.,<emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>1998</phrase>
      </emphasis>), although agreement between self-descriptions and informant descriptions of PDs within clinical samples has at times been criticized due to substantial variability across studies in agreement between self- and informant-reports (Miller &amp; Lynam, <emphasis role="CitationRef">
         <phrase>2015</phrase>
      </emphasis>). When selecting informants with the client to complete informant-reports, it is necessary to consider the relation of the informant to the client, how long they have known the client, and in what contexts. As PDs are pervasive, consistent across contexts, and begin in young adulthood typically, it is important the informant has known the individual at the<indexterm significance="normal">
         <primary>the</primary>
      </indexterm>appropriate age (i. e., not exclusively in childhood) in multiple contexts, if possible.</para>
