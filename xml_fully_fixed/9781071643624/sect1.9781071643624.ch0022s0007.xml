   <title>Dos and Don’ts</title>
   <itemizedlist role="UnorderedListMarkNone">
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do remember that older adults are heterogeneous and functional level should be considered over numerical age as a risk factor for poor outcomes (e. g., a 90-year-old in excellent physical condition may outperform a 60-year-old with frailty).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do educate yourself as to the facts of normative aging to reduce the impact of assumptions or implicit biases and be aware of ageism and internalized ageism in yourself and clients.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do engage in routine screening for problems in cognition, sleep, substance use, and mood (anxiety and depression) given the high prevalence rates, risks associated with under-detection, and availability of evidence-based interventions for these disorders that can increase quality of life.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do assess change in symptoms not just presence of symptoms; change in a symptom is often more relevant than its presence, especially when the symptom (e. g. impaired sleep or pain) is prevalent and long-lasting.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do adopt a stance of cultural humility and work to understand the cultural-, cohort-, or context-related beliefs, values, and behaviors that may frame the experiences of your older patient. This includes avoiding a youth-centric lens.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do evaluate the patient’s social support network and engage with family members and caregivers with patient permission.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do comprehensively evaluate patient medical history, as later life is associated with increased incidence of medical conditions. This includes physical conditions requiring medical treatment, current medications and other treatments, the status of the medical issue, and functional impacts.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do use cognitive, mood, anxiety, or other symptom screening and assessment measures normed and/or validated for use with older adults. If unavailable, interpret measures not validated for older adults with caution.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do not focus solely on functional problems or be limited by a deficit model. Older adults, as with any age group, bring unique strengths. Recommendations should incorporate a strengths-based perspective and include reinforcing adaptive coping in alignment with the client’s values.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do not confuse aging with illness or the chronicity of a problem. The individual’s functioning level and stage of the illness is more predictive of outcome than the age of the patient.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do not assume that emotional or cognitive problems, personality traits, adaptations, or self-narratives are immutable in older adults, as there is evidence for plasticity.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do not engage in “elder speak” when interviewing older adults, assume familiarity on a first meeting (e. g., addressing by a first name rather than a last name), or direct your questions only to a caregiver.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para role="Para">Do not be overly verbose or reliant on psychological jargon in documentation. Reports should be clear and concise, particularly for settings such as geriatric integrated primary care where other providers may use the report to guide care.</para>
