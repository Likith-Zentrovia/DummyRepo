This diagnostic group has undergone significant modifications over the past decade. The Somatoform Disorders in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>) were replaced by the renamed and reconceptualized group of SSRD in the fifth revision of the DSM (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Somatic Symptom Disorder</em> (SSD) replaced the previous diagnostic entities of Somatization Disorder, Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorders, and Pain Disorder in the DSM-IV. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">FNSD</em>) represents the equivalent to the former Conversion Disorder, as does <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Illness Anxiety Disorder</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">IAD</em>) to the former Hypochondriasis. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">PFAOMC</em>) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Factitious Disorder</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">FD</em>) were not included in the former group of Somatoform Disorders in the DSM-IV but in other chapters. By introducing the SSRD, the <span id="ITerm3">requirement</span> of distinguishing between medically unexplained and explained physical symptoms was abolished and the focus was shifted to symptom-related psychological distress. In this sense, the DSM-5 makes an impactful step in counteracting body-mind dualism by including psychological features as classification criteria and conceptualizing somatic symptoms in terms of a biopsychosocial model. In the following, the features of each SSRD are described in detail. Note these disorders were not revised in the text revision of the DSM-5, the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading">Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)</h3><div class="Para" id="Par3">SSD is characterized by the occurrence of one or more somatic symptom(s) that are distressing and result in significant disruption of daily life. The somatic symptom has to be accompanied by at least one of the following <span id="ITerm4">psychological</span> features: disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptom, persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms, or excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns. Symptoms have to be present for more than 6 months. To specify symptom persistence, dominance of pain symptoms, and level of symptom severity, the DSM-5-TR provides different specifiers.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD)</h3><p class="Para" id="Par9">The central feature of <span id="ITerm10">IAD</span><span id="ITerm11"/> is intense fear about the possibility of having or developing a serious illness. The DSM-5-TR criteria of IAD (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) emphasize the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absence</em> of somatic symptoms. The focus is on worrying and typical illness behaviors (e.g., frequent visits to physicians to seek reassurance about a feared illness). Individuals who predominantly experience somatic symptoms and who present with anxieties about their symptoms and behaviors that aim at symptom relief are classified with SSD. A substantial subgroup of individuals with IAD avoids physicians due to intense anxiety about receiving a <span id="ITerm12">confirmation</span><span id="ITerm13"/> of a diagnosis they fear (Scarella et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD)</h3><div class="Para" id="Par10">Individuals diagnosed with <span id="ITerm14">FNSD</span><span id="ITerm15"/> show symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In contrast to the SSD diagnosis, it is required that a clinical examination provides evidence that the symptom cannot be explained by a recognized neurological or medical condition. Symptoms are diverse (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">12.1</a></span>; Espay et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Terms such as “conversion disorder” or “psychogenic” that have been used as an equivalent to FNSD are not well accepted anymore. They refer to underlying mechanisms, that is, unconscious, psychodynamic processes in patients, which are <span id="ITerm16">not</span><span id="ITerm17"/> necessarily present. In contrast, “functional symptoms” refer to an abnormal functioning of the central nervous system and are rather of descriptive nature. To make the diagnosis of an FNSD, it is essential that the diagnostic process does not depend on excluding other disorders but on the examination of so-called positive signs. For example, a positive sign to diagnose functional leg weakness would be the <span id="ITerm18">Hoover sign</span>. The Hoover sign is present if a weak hip extension is corrected when the patient flexes the contralateral hip <span id="ITerm19">against </span><span id="ITerm20"/>resistance (Espay et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_12_Chapter/106097_6_En_12_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.48em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 12.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Symptoms of Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Note.</em> The <span id="ITerm21">phenomenology </span><span id="ITerm22"/>and symptoms of Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder are various and can be classified within four categories: motor symptoms, speech symptoms, symptoms with sensory manifestation, and paroxysmal symptoms including seizures (Espay et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).

The effect of psychological factor(s) on the medical condition has to be evident, although it is possible that the direct causal effect underlying the relationship cannot be fully demonstrated. Medical conditions for which PFAOMC can be diagnosed are various and can be identified in different medical specialties (see an overview in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">12.2</a></span>) (Porcelli &amp; Sonino, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_12_Chapter/106097_6_En_12_Fig2_HTML.png" style="width:34.5em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 12.2</span><p class="SimplePara">Examples of psychological factors classified as PFAOMC. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Note.</em> <span id="ITerm25">Selection</span><span id="ITerm26"/> of psychological factors that have been demonstrated to affect medical conditions, in the sense of the DSM-5 diagnosis Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (PFAOMC).

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Factitious Disorder (FD)</h3><p class="Para" id="Par12">A diagnosis of <span id="ITerm27">FD</span><span id="ITerm28"/> is made when individuals intentionally feign or produce either somatic or psychological symptoms, although there is no obvious external incentive (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The term FD is historically related to the “<span id="ITerm29">Munchausen’s Syndrome</span>” which is a more severe form of chronic fabrication of symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>; Hausteiner-Wiehle &amp; Hungerer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). The DSM-5-TR differentiates between FD Imposed on Self and FD Imposed on Another (or “by Proxy”). FD Imposed on Another is an ethically and legally complex disorder, in which the perpetrator’s <span id="ITerm30">behavior </span><span id="ITerm31"/>might represent criminal behavior. A more modern form of FD is indicated as “by internet” or “by Google,” when stories of illness are disseminated on the internet. Methods that individuals who are diagnosed with FD apply to feign or produce symptoms vary. Examples are false or exaggerated reports of symptoms, exacerbating existing disease (e.g., interfering with wound healing), psychiatric symptoms through use of psychoactive <span id="ITerm32">substances</span><span id="ITerm33"/>, manipulating laboratory test, or induced bleeding.</p></section>

Symptoms of FNSD and PFAOMC have to be explored through unstructured clinical interviews. There are no validated structured/semi-structured clinical interviews available to assess SSRD in children and adolescents.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec10"><h4 class="Heading">Gaining Information from Medical Files and Other Healthcare Providers</h4><p class="Para" id="Par14"><span id="ITerm35">SSRD</span><span id="ITerm36"/><span id="ITerm37"/><span id="ITerm38"/> constitute a group of diagnostic entities in the interface between psychology, medicine, and other disciplines. Therefore, it is crucially important that diagnostic information, if accessible, is gained from medical files and other healthcare providers of a patient in addition to a clinical interview and other procedures of gaining diagnostic information. This information impacts different stages of the diagnostic and treatment process. For example, it makes a difference to plan a psychological treatment for individuals whose symptoms are explained by an identifiable medical diagnosis compared to individuals who present with symptoms that currently cannot be medically explained (e.g., supporting the individual in accepting to <span id="ITerm39">have</span><span id="ITerm40"/><span id="ITerm41"/><span id="ITerm42"/> a diagnosed progressive chronic illness).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec11"><h4 class="Heading">Self-Report and Clinician-Rated Scales to Assess Symptoms of SSRD and Associated Features</h4><p class="Para" id="Par15">In addition to clinical <span id="ITerm43">interviews</span>, using self-report or clinician-rated scales to assess the symptoms and associated cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features of SSRD is recommended. Moreover, validated scales exist to gain the following additional information that can support the diagnostic process: (a) impact of somatic symptoms on individuals’ physical, social and emotional functioning in their daily life, (b) ways of coping with somatic symptoms, (c) perceived self-efficacy and locus of control, and (d) symptom perceptions (e.g., individuals’ expectations about course and timeline of symptoms).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec12"><h4 class="Heading">Prospective Assessment Tools</h4><p class="Para" id="Par16">Memory bias in <span id="ITerm44">the</span> assessment of somatic symptoms is common. Prospective measures, such as symptom diaries, can help individuals to provide a more accurate symptom report. They support the diagnostic process, help with planning the treatment for an individual, and can be used to monitor changes in symptoms during the course of the treatment as well. Some patients might be worried that their symptoms could deteriorate through paying more attention to them and are hesitant to complete a diary. These worries should be validated and the benefits of using a diary emphasized. Individuals should be invited to complete a diary only for a limited period of time (e.g., a week during the diagnostic phase and another week at the end of the treatment).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec13"><h4 class="Heading">Informants Other Than Healthcare Providers</h4><p class="Para" id="Par17">Involving <span id="ITerm45">individuals</span> from patients’ environment to gain diagnostic information is important for several different reasons. First, as mentioned earlier, the retrospective memory of somatic symptoms and their course can be inaccurate or biased. Therefore, family members and friends of the patients and their observations of the patient’s symptoms in daily life can add important information to the diagnostic process. Second, living with persistent somatic symptoms has an impact on an individual’s social life. It is not uncommon <span id="ITerm46">that </span>patients with SSRD feel disrespected and misunderstood by their social system. Associated with problematic and less supportive social interactions, these patients report decreased self-confidence, avoidant coping behaviors, increased stress, and problematic symptom appraisals. Learning about problems in social interaction both from individuals with SSRD themselves as well <span id="ITerm47">as</span> from their family members and friends offers important information for the diagnostic process.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec14"><h4 class="Heading">Behavioral Observation</h4><p class="Para" id="Par18">Observational <span id="ITerm48">methods</span> are a central part of diagnosing certain SSRD. For example, in individuals with FNSD with motor symptoms, the clinician will have to observe the intensity and quality of the symptoms. Illness behaviors, which are central features of several of the SSRD, can be very subtle, highly automated, and difficult for patients to describe (e.g., body scanning, avoidance behavior). Behavioral observation is needed to identify these behaviors (Oliveira et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>; Vlaeyen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a></span>).</p></section>

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec15"><h3 class="Heading">Additional Interview Considerations</h3><section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec16"><h4 class="Heading">Building a Relationship with the Patient’s Healthcare Providers</h4><p class="Para" id="Par19">As <span id="ITerm49">mentioned</span> earlier, gaining information from other healthcare providers plays a central role in the diagnostic process of SSRD. Assuming the patient provides consent, healthcare providers should be contacted, updated about the diagnostic outcome, and a collaborative relationship should be established. If physicians who are involved in the patient’s treatment made a medical diagnosis, it is recommended to gain information about this condition. Being informed when starting the diagnostic process helps patients to feel understood and taken seriously and helps the interviewer to add relevant questions.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec17"><h4 class="Heading">Patients with a Biomedical Symptom Model</h4><p class="Para" id="Par20">Many patients with <span id="ITerm50">SSRD</span><span id="ITerm51"/> struggle with understanding why they are seen by healthcare providers other than physicians. Patients often experience their symptom(s) of primarily somatic but not psychological nature. Being sent to a psychologist or psychiatrist, or statements such as “your symptoms are caused in your brain” can be extremely confusing and can cause patients to feel dismissed or stigmatized as somebody who makes up symptoms. Part of the diagnostic process is therefore to explore how much the patient has already adopted a biopsychosocial than solely biomedical understanding of their symptoms.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec18"><h4 class="Heading">Assessing Somatic Symptoms in Persons with Intellectual or Other Disabilities or in Nonverbal Individuals</h4><p class="Para" id="Par21"><span id="ITerm52">Cognitive impairment</span><span id="ITerm53"/> has been demonstrated to be associated with an inability to rate symptom intensity with numerical rating scales. Patients who are unable to complete traditional self-report scales may be able to complete verbal pain rating scales that use simple phrases to describe different intensities of a symptom. When communication is impossible or the self-report is discordant, clinicians can resort to observational/behavioral symptom scales. Especially for pain symptoms, several scales have been developed and validated, e.g., the Chronic Pain Scale for Nonverbal Adults with Intellectual Disability (CPS-NAID; Burkitt et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec19"><h4 class="Heading">Tools to Improve Rapport</h4><p class="Para" id="Par22"><span id="ITerm54">Sometimes</span> patients with SSRD can experience difficulties with putting their symptom perceptions into words. Creative methods, such as the use of pain cards (Semino et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) or photovoice (Teti et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>), can be helpful to facilitate the patient’s description of their problem. These methods can help patients to disclose sensitive and emotional aspects of the impact of the symptoms on their life.</p></section>

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec20"><h3 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information Specific to Factitious Disorder</h3><div class="Para" id="Par23"><span id="ITerm55">Factitious Disorder</span><span id="ITerm56"/> constitutes a challenging diagnostic entity of the SSRD. It cannot be identified through common interview techniques and assessment tools. Red flags and symptoms have to be observed and consistently documented through a treatment team (Hausteiner-Wiehle &amp; Hungerer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Yates &amp; Feldman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). Often patients open up in particular to non-medical staff. In the following, some typical red flags are listed (Hausteiner-Wiehle &amp; Hungerer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>):<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkDash"><li><p class="Para" id="Par24">Visible clinical signs, e.g., changed skin color, wound edges, blisters, strangulation marks.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par25">Contradictory results of medical/psychological examination.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par26">Uncommon course of healing (e.g., patient’s symptoms deteriorate prior to discharge).</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par27">Clinician’s presence associated with symptom changes.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par28">Witnessed observation of patient manipulating tests, inducing symptoms, and other illness behaviors.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par29">Indicators of <span id="ITerm57">(suspected) </span><span id="ITerm58"/>manipulations of patient’s medical history.</p></li></ul></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par30">Assessing the risk of <span id="ITerm59">self-harming</span> and <span id="ITerm60">suicidal behavior</span> (Posner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) is one of the most central steps of the diagnostic interviewing of individuals with FD. It is important to avoid developing prejudice towards patients to be saboteurs. Supportive confrontation and providing the patient with a safe space to disclose are the basic communication tools.

In addition to determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria, clinicians have the opportunity to rate the severity of the disorder on a scale from 1 (normal) to 7 (extreme) based on their clinical judgment of the patient’s current level of distress. Interrater and test-retest reliability across all diagnoses were rated very good to excellent, and evidence for convergent validity was established for almost all diagnoses (Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).

Similar to the <span id="ITerm68">DIAMOND</span>, the questions of the SCID-5 operationalize the diagnostic criteria of the disorder in DSM-5. The clinician has to choose between whether a symptom is absent/subthreshold or the threshold is met. So far, psychometric data are provided for the clinical version of the SCID-5 regarding validity, sensitivity and specificity, interrater reliability, as well as test-retest reliability (Osorio et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">Another semi-structured interview that was specifically designed to evaluate emotional and related disorders and claims to be more circumscribed compared to the SCID and DIAMOND is the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ADIS-5</em>)<span id="ITerm69"/> by Brown and Barlow (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).

<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec27"><h4 class="Heading">Behavioral Observation Tools</h4><p class="Para" id="Par38">Avoidance behavior (e.g., avoiding certain movements because of the fear of inducing pain) is a very common illness behavior across different types of SSRD that needs special attention in the diagnostic process because it can turn into a subtle yet highly automated behavior. Observational methods can help clinicians to identify and characterize avoidance behavior. The <span id="ITerm79">Photograph Series of Daily Activities (PHODA)</span> is a popular tool to observe pain-related <span id="ITerm80">avoidance</span> behaviors (Oliveira et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p></section>

According to the PedIMMPACT (McGrath et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>) recommendations, traditional self-report tools to rate pain intensity can be used for children who are 8 years of age or older. Unidimensional measures such as visual analogue scales, numerical rating scales, or verbal rating scales (Lalloo &amp; Stinson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>) are available. For children who are in pre-school age (5–7 years), graphic rating scales, e.g., Pieces of Hurt Tool (Hester, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a></span>), should be applied. Observational/behavioral scales are suggested for children who are 5 years of age or younger. There are several scales validated for children who are aged between 0 and 5 years, e.g., COMFORTneo (van Dijk et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>).

According to Sabrina, the pain spreading across her body has existed for more than 7 years and has become unbearable. She feels very frustrated after her enormous but unsuccessful efforts to gain control over her pain. Sabrina gave consent to contact her PCP as well as her pain physician. Both doctors confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, a series of different diagnostic and treatment procedures Sabrina has undergone and that she has changed her healthcare providers several times.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">Sabrina was asked to complete the <span id="ITerm84">DIAMOND</span> Self Report Screener before her first session with us and affirmed the screening questions on a depressive episode, substance use disorders, and SSD. During <span id="ITerm85">the</span> first two sessions, we conducted the corresponding sections of the DIAMOND with Sabrina. The interview confirmed that she meets all criteria of SSD. Sabrina reported various especially future-related worries. Sabrina reported emotions of anxiety, deep sadness, helplessness, and desperation, but also anger about her pain. Sabrina experiences the severe impact of the pain on numerous domains of her life. The <span id="ITerm86">DIAMOND</span> confirmed that Sabrina meets the criteria of an episode of severe depression lasting for about 12 months and associated with occasional suicidal ideation. The suicidal risk assessment was conducted by applying the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Conducting the substance use disorder section of the DIAMOND reveals Sabrina’s abuse of opioids. By asking Sabrina additional questions (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">12.1</a></span>), <span id="ITerm87">we</span> learned about her biomedical model of her persistent symptoms and low expectations regarding psychological interventions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">We asked Sabrina to complete four brief self-report scales, which were evaluated together with her in the second session. The Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale confirmed the severity of psychological symptoms of the SSD. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia revealed her avoidance behaviors in various domains of her everyday life. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale provided more insight into her disturbing thoughts associated with her symptoms. The Patients’ Endorsement of the Biopsychosocial Model of Chronic Pain Scale confirmed the clinician’s assumption that psychoeducation and cognitive reappraisal of the patient’s pain <span id="ITerm88">perceptions</span> would be an important component of the treatment plan. After the second session, Sabrina was invited to complete a symptom diary (e.g., Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">12.3</a></span>) over the upcoming 7 days.

He often travels abroad for his work. After the last travel to an African country 1 year ago, Jeff returned with a bacterial infection of his bowel and suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms over a week. His PCP treated him successfully with antibiotics. Jeff felt very distressed by this infection and about future international travel. In the meantime, he developed persistent anxieties that he, for sure, suffers from a very rare form of bowel infection that is currently asymptomatic but could break out again in the future and that cannot be treated with common antibiotics. Every little change of his stool and gastrointestinal habits confuses Jeff and causes him to urgently and persistently seek advice from his PCP. He has changed his PCP several times over the <span id="ITerm91">past </span>year because <span id="ITerm92">he</span> cannot trust that the doctor has checked his condition sufficiently. He is worried about his future in the company he is working for, given that he has refused any further job-related travel since last year. Jeff started to restrict his diet and to be very selective about the places he eats food from. This also implies that he withdrew from several of his social contacts.</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Conducting the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders in the first and second session showed that Jeff meets the criteria of an IAD but no other mental health disorder.

After the first session, we asked Jeff to complete the Short Health Anxiety Inventory as well as the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21. Jeff showed increased scores on the health anxiety scale of the SHAI as well as increased beliefs of negative consequences of becoming ill, which is important information for later treatment planning, especially cognitive interventions. Although Jeff <span id="ITerm94">does</span> not meet criteria of depression, his score on the depression scale of the DASS-21 was in the moderate range.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Jeff lives together with his partner John.

If John declines to provide this reassurance, Jeff often reacts with distance and expresses that he does not feel taken seriously. We asked Jeff to complete a diary on his health anxieties over the 7 days between the second and third session. We created this diary on our own and asked about the triggers of the health anxiety, anxiety intensity (scale 0–100%), unhelpful thoughts, and how much the patient believes in them (scale 0–100%) and <span id="ITerm96">focuses</span> on <span id="ITerm97">his</span> body (0–100%).</p></div></section>

It seems however that gender-related distribution of symptom report is also influenced by cultural factors. A study by Piccinelli and Simon (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>) showed that the higher prevalence in women is especially common in Western societies.

Regarding FD, the prevalence is as twice as high for women compared to men, and regarding FD by Proxy, most of the abusers are female and the victim’s mother (Yates &amp; Bass, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). IAD on the contrary seems to be relatively evenly distributed between men and women (Scarella et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p></section>

There have not been differences between IAD patients and the general population in terms of age (Scarella et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). <span id="ITerm100">FNSD</span> can occur across the lifespan (Feinstein, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).

Across different medical specialties and presentations, individuals who are affected by FD are usually younger, peak prevalence in the middle of their 30s (Hausteiner-Wiehle &amp; Hungerer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Yates &amp; Feldman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).

Syndromes of SSD were increased in South American centers. The Epidemiological Catchment Area Study (Robins &amp; Regier, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a></span>) in the USA revealed increased prevalence rates of syndromes of multiple persistent somatic symptoms in Black women and men.

However, these studies are dated from the 1990s and their results are outdated, thus they should be interpreted carefully.

One huge problem is that studies examining transcultural differences in SSRD and somatic symptom report use scales that have mainly been developed in Western countries and are not sensitive toward culturally specific symptoms. Somatic symptoms are, however, prominent in so-called “<span id="ITerm105">cultural concepts of distress</span>,” defined as “ways that cultural groups <span id="ITerm106">experience</span>, understand, and communicate suffering, behavioral problems, or troubling thoughts and emotions” (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 871). An example is Ataque de nervios, a syndrome in individuals of Latin descent, which includes intense emotional upset and various somatic symptoms such as trembling, heat in the chest, or seizure-like episodes. The DSM-5-TR provides a glossary of nine cultural concepts of distress. We strongly recommend to additionally apply the Cultural Formulation Interview (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) in a diagnostic process to assess SSDR in individuals with a cultural background <span id="ITerm107">different</span> from the interviewers’ cultural background.</p></section>

Depressive Disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic symptoms; however, a Depressive Disorder is distinguished from SSRD through the cardinal symptoms of depression. Individuals with depression can excessively ruminate about health and illness.

Clinicians conducting interviews with individuals with SSRD should be aware that the diagnostic sessions do not just have the purpose to make a diagnosis but to build a therapeutic relationship and to facilitate patients’ readiness to adopt an interdisciplinary treatment approach including psychological interventions. The following Dos and Don’ts shall help guide clinicians through the diagnostic process.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec41"><h3 class="Heading">Dos</h3><p class="Para" id="Par59">Reflect on your own emotions toward patients with persistent somatic symptoms. If you observe negative emotions and attitudes, first think about how you can handle them. Demonstrate genuine interest in your way of asking questions and understanding the patient. Validate the reality of the symptom severity and interference. Although the diagnostic sessions focus on making a diagnosis, it is helpful for patients to be aware of what psychology can offer and what it cannot. Be transparent about patients’ proactive role in the therapeutic process. Use the opportunity that patients have often not been taken seriously and that you now provide time to understand them. Patients also have a strong need to find explanations for their symptoms. For patients, finding causes usually is the first step to finding a successful treatment. Be validating toward patients’ needs, but at the same time do not get involved in unfruitful, frustrating discussions of symptom attributions and potential causes. Introduce psychotherapy as a “second treatment path,” which opens new perspectives and approaches in addition to the approaches the patient has already applied. Apply techniques from the Motivational Interviewing approach (e.g., ask open questions, active listening, validation, summarizing) (Miller &amp; Rollnick, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). In case the patient has a known medical condition, inform yourself about it. Gain the patient’s consent to contact other healthcare providers involved in the patient’s treatment and access to the patient’s medical file. Emphasize the patient’s autonomy in decision-making and if they want to move on with a psychological treatment. Keep an open mind regarding etiology: maybe the symptom cannot be completely explained under the current circumstances. This does not mean that there will be no explanations in the future. Most important is that the patient currently does not only focus on the intensity of the symptom but also on how distressing the symptom is and the negative impact it has.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec42"><h3 class="Heading">Don’ts</h3><p class="Para" id="Par60">Don’t tell patients that they “will have to live with it” or that “symptoms are produced in their mind or brain.” Don’t use terms that imply a biopsychosocial nature of the symptom too early in the interaction with the patient, such as “psychosomatic,” “psychogenic,” “somatoform,” or “psychological/mental.” Don’t make decisions for the patient or fall into body-mind dichotomous thinking (e.g., “We cannot find a medical cause, for this reason your symptom is psychosomatic”). Avoid providing reassurance that your patient does not have an organic disease.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec43"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par61">Somatic Symptoms and Related Disorders are a very heterogeneous group of mental disorders. They include disorders characterized by persistent somatic symptoms with associated distress and disability (SSD, FNSD), by a cognitive preoccupation of having or gaining a somatic condition (IAD), by psychological factors that impact the onset and perpetuation of somatic symptoms (PFAOMC), or by induced somatic or mental symptoms (FD). Compared to other mental disorders, it is important to consider that SSRD are phenomena in the intersection between medicine, psychology, and other healthcare disciplines. That makes the diagnostic process unique compared to other disorders, and in addition to the application of common diagnostic tools in mental health (e.g., structured interviews, self-report, and observational tools), it is important to establish a collaborative relationship with your patient’s other healthcare providers. If possible and if time is given, the diagnostician should involve also informants from the patient’s environment.</p></section>
