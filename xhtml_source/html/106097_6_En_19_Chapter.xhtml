As <span id="ITerm1">life </span><span id="ITerm2"/><span id="ITerm3"/><span id="ITerm4"/>expectancy has dramatically increased over the past century, and more adults experience healthier and longer lives, this basic question has taken on a special urgency. Aging, by <span id="ITerm5">definition</span>, is a lifelong biological process, linked to socio-cultural referents and potentially accelerated or slowed by factors as varied as genetics and lifestyle (American Psychological Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Current social convention typically defines older adulthood as beginning around 60–65 years. Based upon this convention, older adults currently comprise 16% of the US population, or 54 million people, and with the aging of the baby boomer cohort, will comprise 22% of the population by 2040 (Administration on Aging, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Importantly, the older adult population reflects a heterogenous spectrum across functioning and health status, racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and cultural identities, geographical location, and financial/housing security. Of the current older adult population in the United States, 61% identify as White (US Census, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>) with projections for increasing racial and ethnic diversity, with the aging Latinx population to experience the most substantial growth (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Furthermore, though exact estimates are difficult due to lack of consistently collected epidemiological data, by the year 2030, there will be approximately seven million older adult Americans who identify as LGBTQ+ (GLAAD, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). Therefore, approaches to diagnostic interviewing <span id="ITerm6">with</span> older adults must integrate and center a lens of cultural responsiveness, cultural humility, and inclusive and affirming practices (Dixon et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Critical to clinical work with older adults is also an awareness of and efforts to mitigate the impacts of ageism. Unfortunately, age-related bias continues to be pervasive and can substantially impact the process and results of a diagnostic interview both in implicit and explicit ways. One way to avoid ageism is to not assume homogeneity across older adults or to equate age with functionality. Thus, this chapter includes discussion of risk and contextual factors that can assist clinicians to differentiate diagnoses from each other and from normal aging processes. Recommendations will be provided throughout for approaches to diagnostic interviewing that balance the unique needs and circumstances of older adults as a whole with also tending to heterogeneity in aging. Overall, the purpose of this chapter is to provide mental health clinicians with contextual information on psychological conditions in older adults, guidelines for the interview process that may be distinctive for older adult patients, and issues to weigh when determining a diagnosis and recommendations.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Unique Considerations for Diagnosis and Assessment of Older Adults</h3><p class="Para" id="Par4">The Pike’s Peak Model for Training in Geropsychology (Knight et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>) defines four <span id="ITerm7">overarching</span> competencies that are relevant to interviewing older adults. A basic knowledge of normal aging as a reference point for holistic assessment is a primary competency. Normal aging is characterized by biological, cognitive, and psychological changes and can be impacted by disease, genetics, diet/exercise, environment (e.g., resource access), social support, mental health, personality, culture, and attitudes around aging. Broadly speaking, the realities of normal aging contradict common myths about older adulthood. Examples of such myths include the perception that older adulthood is characterized by loneliness, physical frailty, cognitive decline, and depressed mood. While some older adults may experience cognitive, emotional, and physical challenges, most do not (Mitina et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). When conducting a diagnostic interview with an older adult, it is important to recognize the heterogeneity of the aging process and substantial variance that occurs across individuals and biopsychosocial domains.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">A second <span id="ITerm8">foundational </span>knowledge competency is an understanding of unique aspects of psychological conditions in late life. An awareness of differences in prevalence rates, age of onset, phenomenology, measurement, and differential risk and protective factors is fundamental to accurately diagnosing psychological conditions in older adults (Knight et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). A number of these factors will be discussed throughout the chapter. Thirdly, since medical illness is common in this population, mental health clinicians should understand the interplay between physical and psychological health, and their relationship to functional impairment in later life. These problems often present concurrently and have reciprocal relationships, requiring the evaluation and distinction of physical and psychological health factors’ <span id="ITerm9">contributions</span> to functional change. Finally, clinicians working with older adults should recognize age-specific environmental contexts in which older adults reside. Older adults may reside or be assessed in a variety of environments and settings or contexts (e.g., community vs. long-term care; medical vs. psychiatric; living with family/others vs. alone). Accurate assessment and related recommendations may occur at the level of the person, environment, or both and require knowledge of age-specific systems, and familial and cultural contexts (for additional information on <span id="ITerm10">working</span> with older adults, see American Psychological Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Prevalence and Nature of Mental Disorders in Older Adults</h3><p class="Para" id="Par6">One purpose of interviewing and assessing older adults is to determine an accurate diagnosis, which includes detecting problems that would otherwise be masked, distinguishing mental disorders from typical emotional states, and differentiating one mental disorder from another. Doing so requires basic knowledge of the prevalence of mental disorders, sub-clinical psychological symptoms, and high-priority clinical issues, such as suicidal behavior, in older adults. Some general principles guide the evidence-based <span id="ITerm11">assessment</span> of older adults: (1) Most major psychiatric syndromes (disorders) occur at lower rates than in mixed-age adults; (2) Symptom presentations of these syndromes may differ in older adults; (3) These syndromes are more likely to present in the context of medical illness.</p><section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec5"><h4 class="Heading">Prevalence Rates</h4><div class="Para" id="Par7">Epidemiological <span id="ITerm12">studies</span> of the prevalence of major psychiatric syndromes repeatedly demonstrate that across almost all mental disorders affecting older adults, apart from cognitive impairment, prevalence in older adults is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">lower</em> compared to younger or mixed-age populations (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">19.1</a></span> and Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">19.1</a></span>). Specifically, rates for mood, anxiety, substance use, schizophrenia spectrum, and personality disorders are lower in older than in younger adults (Jacobs &amp; Bamonti, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Notably, rates of these disorders generally decrease with increasing age even after age 65 (except for those 85+) and gender differences appear less prominent. As these prevalence data are derived from cross-sectional studies, it is possible <span id="ITerm13">that </span>age differences may be due to cohort differences, and some suggest that rates may be higher in future studies as the “baby boomer” cohort fully enters older adulthood. Of note, older adults also tend to report lower rates of anxious and depressive symptoms than younger adults following national disasters and global stressors such as the <span id="ITerm14">COVID-19 pandemic</span> (Ettman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).

Of note, rates for major neurocognitive disorder, which includes Alzheimer’s type dementia and related disorders, tend to increase linearly with age, such that rates at age 60–65 (3%) are considerably lower than rates for those aged 90+ (35%). Prevalence rates for minor neurocognitive disorders, which may be more dynamic and reversible, tend to be higher (22–27%) but more stable with age (Manly et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Although differential survival may play some role, these rates also suggest that cognitive impairment is common but not inevitable, <span id="ITerm17">even</span> in the oldest old.

For example, although older adults are less likely to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder relative to younger adults, subthreshold depressive symptoms are more common in older adult men (10–12%) and women (15–18%) and may increase slightly with age (National Institute on Aging, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). Older adults appear less likely than younger adults to endorse affective and ideational symptoms (Krishnamoorthy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), but more likely to report difficulties with sleep, appetite, fatigue, and executive functioning, suggesting that screening tools ideally should account for all of these. A similar picture emerges from research on anxiety disorders, in that <span id="ITerm20">older </span>adults are less likely than younger adults to meet the criteria for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, but worry-based disorders (such as generalized anxiety disorder [GAD] and agoraphobia) may be more common. Rates of subthreshold anxiety symptoms (17–21%) remain relatively higher, however (Jacobs &amp; Bamonti, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Thus, screening for subthreshold symptoms may be warranted and some screening instruments (e.g., GAD-7 [general anxiety disorder 7-item]) developed for younger populations may require recalibrated norms or cutoff scores for older adults (Vasiliadis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). Further, difference in prevalence depending on context should be considered, as well as the need for screening; for example, posttraumatic stress disorder is more common in military veteran populations, particularly in those who use VA services (Moye et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Evaluation of sleep-wake disorders is also of relevance to clinicians working with older adults. Sleep disorders relate to cognition and may even represent early signs of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease <span id="ITerm21">and</span> dementia with Lewy bodies (Arvanitakis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec6"><h4 class="Heading">High Priority Concerns</h4><p class="Para" id="Par10">Knowledge <span id="ITerm22">regarding</span> unique threats to safety is of paramount importance in clinical interviewing with older adults and includes careful assessment of (1) risk factors for suicide, (2) dementia-related self-neglect or risk of harming others, and (3) elder abuse. As older adults, and particularly older White men (age 75+) have the highest rate of death by suicide in the United States, routine evaluation is warranted (Mize et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). Assessment of immediate risk factors, such as current suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, might begin with high-sensitivity queries (e.g., “Have you wished that you might fall asleep and not wake up?” or “Do you sometimes have thoughts that life is not worth living?”) and proceed to questions more specific to suicide (“Have you been thinking about how you might do this?”) drawn from measures such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Mai et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Older adults are more likely to express serious <span id="ITerm23">intent </span>and use lethal means (e.g., firearms), and rates are higher among isolated individuals, those in rural communities, and those with depression or substance use disorders (Mize et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). Unique stressors affecting older adults that can put them at risk for suicidality include declining health, chronic pain, social isolation, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, multiple bereavements, and involuntary retirement (Mize et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Functional status is essential to assess in the context of possible cognitive impairment and implicitly serves as an evaluation of the individual’s safety. Most common safety concerns include risk to others (e.g., driving) or to oneself (e.g., self-neglect or unintentional self-injury). Individuals with major neurocognitive disorders often have impaired functioning in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; e.g., managing bank accounts or medications) and, with progression, activities of daily living (ADLs; e.g., eating, bathing) which can result in safety risks. Those with undetected or unmonitored cognitive impairment may have difficulty with managing cooking, inadequately provide themselves <span id="ITerm24">with</span> nutrition, or difficulty managing medications. Impaired functioning in areas such as driving, managing finances, or caregiving for others may place others’ safety at risk. Depending on the level of impairment, such difficulties may not be noticed by the individual but are commonly reported by caregivers or other collateral sources. In assessing safety and considering collateral information, care should be taken to also attend to the older adult client’s sense of autonomy and differentiate behaviors that are within their capacity to engage in safely and independently (Usher &amp; Stapleton, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">Safety not only includes consideration of community context, but also the older adults’ living and relationship circumstances. Although domestic violence can occur across adults of all ages, older adults with disability, frailty, income insecurity, or cognitive impairment (Lachs &amp; Pillemer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>), as well as LGBTQ+ older adults (Gutman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), are at high risk of elder abuse, which may include physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse, as well as neglect and financial exploitation. An <span id="ITerm25">evaluation</span> of potential elder abuse requires careful attention to issues of consent and confidentiality, separate interviews of an older adult and their caregiver, open-ended interview questions, and validation of concerns for safety, and often consultation with allied <span id="ITerm26">health</span> professionals (Lachs &amp; Pillemer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>; Wang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR65" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec7"><h4 class="Heading">Role of Medical Illness</h4><p class="Para" id="Par13">Because <span id="ITerm27">co-morbid</span> medical illness is so common in later life, older adults’ psychological problems are more likely to occur in the context of medical illness, disability, or the treatments (e.g., medications) for these problems (Agustini et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Medical and psychological disorders often have reciprocal relationships, adding complexity to a diagnostic interview and to interpreting symptom rating scales. For example, it is common for those undergoing cancer treatment to also experience fatigue which can result from cancer treatment, cancer itself, and/or depression (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). It is important to take a careful history of both medical and psychological problems, including the onset of each, and to adopt an <span id="ITerm28">agnostic</span> approach to rating current symptoms. Through such an approach, it might be determined, for example, that the excess fatigue became evident prior to diagnosis of lung cancer and was further exacerbated by the impacts of chemotherapy but that it was not accompanied by other depression symptoms (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Clinicians may engage in a “sorting out” process, often informed by chronological markers in the older adult’s narrative of the problem. Additional information on <span id="ITerm29">differentiating</span> medical and psychological conditions is provided later in this chapter.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><p class="Para" id="Par14">Referral questions and procedures for engaging in the interviewing process vary depending on the setting in which the older adult is evaluated. Medical inpatient, long-term care, and medical outpatient settings often refer older patients due to observed behavioral problems (e.g., problems adhering to treatment recommendations; changes in cognition or mood) and seek a behavioral consult to diagnose a condition, suggest behavioral management strategies to the healthcare team, and provide direct services to the patient. In other cases, the mental health clinician may already be part of an integrated team such as through primary care, palliative care, or home-based care (Rasin-Waters et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>; Zimbroff et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>) services wherein the conducting of clinical interviews may be part of an interdisciplinary geriatric assessment. The clinician should be mindful of safeguarding confidentiality and ensuring informed consent, among other ethical principles, when gathering information from patients, collateral informants, healthcare team members, and the medical record, as well as when reporting information. The following principles and practical guidelines for interviewing older adults are recommended to augment or modify standard interview approaches and can largely apply across settings.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Reduce Practical and Environmental Barriers to Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par15">A basic <span id="ITerm30">aim</span> of diagnostic interviewing is to arrive at conclusions that are maximally reliable, and valid and reflect an older adult’s typical performance. Barriers to standardized assessment, whether individual (e.g., hearing or visual impairment) or environmental (e.g., poor lighting, excess noise, or an interviewing space that cannot assure confidentiality), impede this purpose, as they are sources of extraneous variance that have the potential to skew findings. Before conducting the interview, inquiry as to difficulty with hearing or vision and available means to accommodate these (e.g., use of hearing aids or clinician speaking closer and clearly to an older adult’s “good ear,” glasses, materials in larger font size, or re-positioning of materials), as well as the clinician’s efforts to minimize environmental barriers (e.g., ensuring a quiet, private, well-lit room) will allow for more valid diagnostic conclusions.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec10"><h3 class="Heading">Facilitate a Structured and Supportive Interaction</h3><p class="Para" id="Par16">Since discussing <span id="ITerm31">personal</span> and emotional issues with a novel person is evocative of a type of “strange situation,” clinicians should strive to establish rapport, communicate empathy, validation, support, and adequate structure when eliciting the patient’s narrative. This also involves considering the impact of the clinician’s and patient’s sociocultural frameworks and factoring these in when making diagnoses and recommendations. Culturally competent care with older adults should not only consider various identity factors of the clinician and client, but also an awareness for the impact of implicit ageism and power dynamics related to differences in client or clinician age (Haynes et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">The diagnostic interview begins with the informed consent of the patient, including communicating the purpose of the interview, the nature of questions that will be asked, and the persons with whom findings will be shared. Queries that encourage the description of the chronology of the problem, efforts to cope or seek remedies, and the status of the problem today should be made. Understanding the <span id="ITerm32">temporal</span> relationships between problems (e.g., the onset and treatment of co-morbid medical and psychiatric problems) is often critical to a diagnostic understanding. Furthermore, as older adults’ histories of a problem may span years or decades, and memories for dates over long spans may be inaccurate, it is useful to rely instead on sentinel events in the history (e.g., the onset or dissolution of a partnered relationship, the birth or launching of children, loss of a significant person, onset of a medical problem) as markers. This provides structure and aligns with an experience-near <span id="ITerm33">narrative</span> approach.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec11"><h3 class="Heading">Encourage Collateral Informants</h3><p class="Para" id="Par18"><span id="ITerm34">Collateral informants</span> (a family member, caregiver, friend, home health aide, etc.) can provide a valuable multifaceted view of a person and their functioning and is essential in the evaluation of individuals with suspected <span id="ITerm35">cognitive impairment</span>. In such situations, informants often provide rich information as to the patient’s premorbid history, observations of changes in the patient’s cognition, mood, and functioning, safety concerns, and efforts to seek remedies for the problem. Consent is required before discussions with an informant may occur unless the patient has already been determined to lack decision-making capacity and <span id="ITerm36"/>the informant is their legal healthcare proxy. After consent is granted to also speak to the informant, it is recommended that clinicians begin by eliciting the narrative from the patient, even if <span id="ITerm37">cognitive impairment</span> is clearly present, as this process both safeguards the dignity of the older patient and enables a glimpse into the patient’s interpersonal environment and dynamics. The fostering of a comfortable environment for both the patient and informant is critical and can include basic approaches such as directing inquiries to the patient first, then giving the informant space to speak, and making eye contact with both parties during the discussion. At times, it may be necessary to speak to either the patient <span id="ITerm38"/>or the informant separately after conducting a joint interview.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec12"><h3 class="Heading">Evaluate Response Biases of Older Adult Patients and Informants</h3><p class="Para" id="Par19">Just as <span id="ITerm39">reporting</span> biases are common in self-report measures of mood or personality, so too are they common when employing an interview method of assessment. Some older adults (or collateral informants), and particularly those who may hold perspectives that emotional problems are undesirable or stigmatizing, may under-report some psychiatric symptoms (Mackenzie &amp; Pankratz, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Cohort, cultural, and personality factors may influence differences in response style, mental health literacy, and treatment seeking in older adults (Mackenzie &amp; Pankratz, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Patient-clinician dynamics and sociocultural identities, including age, may also influence reporting. For example, with a younger clinician, an older adult may wonder about their competence or be concerned about disclosing stigmatized physical problems such as urinary incontinence. <span id="ITerm40">With</span> an older clinician, there may be a perception of sameness (for both the patient and clinician) and a resultant desire to appear “fine” when faced with a same-aged peer. Some older adults may be deferential to clinicians depending on their cultural background, viewing the clinician as an expert, while others may be skeptical due to cultural and personal experiences of discrimination in healthcare or fears of ageism and therefore may be guarded (Dixon et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">Discrepant reporting between patients and their informants may also occur, warranting cautious evaluation of the motives and reliability of each. Common scenarios can include an older adult with <span id="ITerm41">cognitive impairment</span> who does not recognize their decline in functional capacity, or a caregiver who minimizes the patient’s cognitive deficits but concedes that they have taken on functional activities (e.g., managing medications) previously performed independently by the patient. Strategies to address potential biases include the use of a multi-method approach, which includes both self-report and performance-based measures, close attention to evaluating discrepancies, and a focus on objective aspects of behavior (e.g., cessation of financial management in the context <span id="ITerm42"/>of possible cognitive impairment).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading">Evaluate Baseline and Change(s) in Behavior and Functioning</h3><p class="Para" id="Par21">Assessing for <span id="ITerm43">changes</span> in behavior and functioning, which include symptoms and impairments in social or occupational functioning, is a core principle of diagnostic interviewing. Since older adults’ life contexts naturally change across the lifecycle, their “new normal” baseline may or may not be characterized as “symptom-free.” For example, as sleep architecture is known to become more fragmented across the lifecycle, and nocturia causes many to briefly awaken, limited daytime napping is common (Li et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Clinicians evaluating for hypersomnia (a symptom of depression) in such individuals should do so by first evaluating the older adult’s baseline sleep pattern. Change from this baseline is a more valid indicator of a potential psychiatric diagnosis than the mere presence of a symptom. A similar approach may also be employed in evaluating functional impairment—change in a given functional ability (e.g., cooking, financial management, driving) is more salient than incapacity for an ability that was never <span id="ITerm44">learned</span> or a valued part of the patient’s functioning.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec14"><h3 class="Heading">Use Measures Normed or Validated with Older Adults</h3><div class="Para" id="Par22">Many screening <span id="ITerm45">measures</span> employed across settings have been developed for a mixed-age population, and some have not been normed or validated for older adult samples. Appropriating such measures for use with older adults assumes psychometric equivalence and this is often not the case. For example, growing evidence suggests that older adults with anxiety syndromes experience less severe autonomic arousal and negative emotional states (common to Panic Disorder and PTSD) than do younger adults (Li et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) and that cutoff scores for some dimensional measures (e.g., posttraumatic stress checklist [PCL-C]) must be adjusted accordingly (Yeager &amp; Magruder, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).

Records can be useful in providing medical or psychiatric history and related medications, as well as documenting prior laboratory tests and previous treatments.

Of note, it is important to maintain a critical stance when reviewing records, being mindful of the potential fallibility of prior evaluations or diagnostic labels, due to reporting biases, variation in clinician interpretation, and the dynamic <span id="ITerm53">nature</span> of various syndromes (e.g., mild neurocognitive impairment).</p></section>

Specific aspects of mental status to attend to, particularly if cognitive impairment is suspected, might include: appearance that shows signs of ability to engage in ADLs (e.g., bathing, dressing), speech changes (e.g., dysarthria), thought process being highly circumstantial or showing word finding issues, and thought content being notably concrete. In conjunction with observations and clinical interview, a thorough diagnostic assessment of an older adult should involve the use of a brief cognitive screener. Even for those who may not have obvious signs of cognitive change, it can be useful to conduct yearly cognitive screening to facilitate <span id="ITerm60">comparison</span><span id="ITerm61"/><span id="ITerm62"/> from baseline to potential future changes. The 3MS Mini Mental Status Exam (Bravo &amp; Hébert, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>; Jones et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>; Teng &amp; Chui, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a></span>) is one reliable and valid screening tool for cognitive impairment. Regardless of the presenting problem, it is also recommended to screen for depression and anxiety symptoms given their prevalence and frequent co-occurrence with other conditions or mimicry of other conditions, particularly in older adults. For example, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Sheikh &amp; Yesavage, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a></span>), Geriatric Anxiety Scale (Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>), and the S-MAST substance abuse screening tool (Hirata et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>) are all validated with samples of older adults. It is important to consider there is a scarcity of instruments normed on older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups. Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3">19.3</a></span> summarizes key measures for cognitive screening, mood screening, substance use, sleep disorders, and risk and sources for older adult <span id="ITerm63">norms</span><span id="ITerm64"/><span id="ITerm65"/> when available.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec19"><h3 class="Heading">Providing Feedback and Recommendations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par27">When providing <span id="ITerm66">feedback</span> on the assessment findings and related recommendations, one psychoeducational model that is recommended is the “ask-tell-ask” approach. In many cases, it may make sense for both the patient and their family and/or caregiver to be present, particularly if there is implication of cognitive impairment. Even if such impairment is not present, it can be helpful for many patients to have another person available to take notes and hear recommendations, given findings can be emotionally distressing or overwhelming for some. Feedback should maintain a focus on the main findings and communicate these in as clear a manner as possible, avoiding the use of jargon. Any remaining uncertainties regarding the diagnosis or further assessment needed should also be communicated. In both <span id="ITerm67"/>the written report and feedback session, recommendations should be provided that are tailored to the individual, including being feasible for their life circumstances (e.g., supports, resources, living setting), comorbidities if relevant, and current problems. Taking a person-centered approach that also highlights and builds on the patient’s strengths is essential not only to promote self-efficacy and dignity but also to enable the patient to be able to take in aspects of the feedback that may be distressing. To that end, recommendations should align with the patient’s values and model of illness <span id="ITerm68"/>and coping with illness.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec20"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustration</h2><p class="Para" id="Par28">We illustrate several key components of interviewing older adults in the following case which focuses on Mr. H., a Black, 70-year-old, cisgender, gay man referred by his primary care provider for evaluation of reported memory complaints following a fall 7 months prior in which he hit the back of his head and suffered a concussion.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec21"><h3 class="Heading">Clinical Interview</h3><p class="Para" id="Par29">Mr. H was evaluated <span id="ITerm69"/>by a psychologist in an outpatient integrated primary care team. He was accompanied by his partner and expressed that he would like him to be in the room during the interview. The examiner began by asking Mr. H to elaborate on his cognitive complaints that prompted the referral. He reported that he has been having difficulty remembering words, appointments, and certain aspects of his history, often remembering details “much later” after being asked. He characterized his memory as having “good days and bad days” over the last 5 months. Mr. H generally denied difficulty with ADLS or IADLS. His partner indicated that he took over cooking and that Mr. H needs reminders to pay the bills.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">In discussing his history, Mr. H revealed that he tripped on a rug in his building 7 months ago, resulting in a fall and concussion. Immediately following the fall, he experienced dizziness, blurred vision, and headaches. He was evaluated by a physician at urgent care, who diagnosed him with a concussion. The physician recommended that Mr. H rest and limit intense physical activity until his symptoms improved, monitor himself for worsening symptoms, and take acetaminophen to manage his headaches. Per Mr. H, <span id="ITerm70">his</span> memory loss began 2 months after the fall and he developed posttraumatic chronic pain from the incident. He became tearful as he recounted these details, telling the examiner that he worried he would be diagnosed with dementia and lose his ability to live independently. The examiner offered an empathic response and emphasized that the purpose of this interview is to better understand his problems and identify potential interventions that will support his goal of preserving autonomy as much as possible.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">When prompted for mood and anxiety symptoms in recent weeks, Mr. H endorsed frequent crying, difficulty sleeping, appetite loss, fatigue, restlessness, nervousness, and feeling frightened about the future. Apart from his psychological symptoms over the past several months, Mr. H experienced severe insomnia and anxiety 10 years ago following a prostate cancer diagnosis. This prompted him to visit a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed him sertraline. Around this <span id="ITerm71">time</span>, he additionally attended individual psychotherapy and couples therapy with his partner; they noted they sought support in navigating the impacts on their relationship, including intimacy. He reported that the medication and therapy sessions were helpful to him and that he stopped all treatments after about 1 year, following reduced distress. Mr. H denied current engagement in mental health treatment, including medications and/or therapy. He denied any current or past suicidal ideation. The examiner also assessed for recreational drug and alcohol use, given the known impact of substance use on cognition. Mr. H reported that, in the past, he struggled with alcohol abuse and sought treatment after meeting his partner, with consistent sobriety for the last 24 years. Mr. H stated that he had never taken any other drugs, including marijuana. He noted that he used to smoke cigarettes but stopped 10 years ago. He reported drinking two cups of caffeinated coffee daily. In terms of additional medical history, Mr. H reported that he received radiation therapy at age 60 for prostate cancer and <span id="ITerm72">hormone</span> treatment for two more years; he has been in remission since then. Mr. H denied any history of head injury beyond the concussion associated with his recent fall and was not aware of a history of dementia in his family.</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Finally, the examiner asked about Mr. H’s social history. Mr. H was born and raised in a rural area in the United States. Though he did not experience learning difficulties in school, he described having had difficulties with his attention. After treatment for alcohol use disorder, Mr. H returned to college to earn his Bachelor’s degree. He reported that most for his career he was employed in foster care administrative roles, until he retired 5 years ago. Mr. H currently lives with his partner of 26 years and their 20-year-old niece in a large city. They married after Mr. H completed prostate cancer treatment as he felt this was a “wake-up call” to the fact that they are getting older and may need more <span id="ITerm73">medical</span> care. He described worrying about how they might be treated as a gay couple if they were not legally married.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec22"><h3 class="Heading">Behavioral Observations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par33">The examiner observed that over the two sessions she met with Mr. H, he arrived on time and presented as well-related, pleasant, and anxious. Mr. H appeared appropriately dressed and well-groomed. His speech was of normal rhythm and volume, although he paused at times when trying to recall certain details of his past. Following the clinical interview, the examiner administered the 3MS as a screening test for dementia on which Mr. H scored 86/100, falling in the tenth percentile relative to other <span id="ITerm74">members</span> of his age group and education level. Though he was agreeable to taking the test, he expressed frustration and worry about his cognition several times while taking it, particularly during tasks of memory and language. The GDS-15 and GAD-7 were also administered to gain more insight into his anxiety and depressive symptoms and scores were 12/15 and 20/21, respectively, suggesting significant depression and anxiety.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">After closing the evaluation, the examiner discussed her initial impressions and recommendations with Mr. H and his partner. She explained that his cognitive changes from his optimal abilities were likely to be <span id="ITerm75">driven</span> by his significant anxiety and depression symptoms, suggestive of current major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. His performance on the 3MS was suggestive of possible minor neurocognitive disorder with his difficulty on some cognitive tasks appearing to be exacerbated by his self-doubt, frustration, anxiety, and pain. The clinician provided brief psychoeducation on the relationship between cognitive performance, emotional symptoms, and chronic pain and explained that addressing his anxiety and depression through psychotherapy may be helpful. She suggested he repeat cognitive screening in a year following this intervention to clarify any additional <span id="ITerm76"/>or persistent cognitive difficulties.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec23"><h3 class="Heading">Key Takeaways</h3><p class="Para" id="Par35">In addition to cognitive screening, older adults presenting with subjective cognitive complaints should be evaluated for emotional symptoms that may be negatively impacting cognition. Diagnostically, a common symptom of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder is difficulty concentrating. This can be associated with difficulties in learning, prompting perceived memory changes. It is important to assess for medical factors that may impact emotional and cognitive complaints. Chronic pain is more common among older adults than in younger adults, and can prompt difficulty concentrating, as well as risk for anxiety and depression. Certain medications (e.g., select muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, and sleep aids) and illicit substances can also impact cognition. Stressors such as coping with a cancer diagnosis and navigating relationship changes can impact emotional states and should be considered as part of a holistic picture in an older adult reporting memory changes. Cognitive screening either 6 months or a year after this initial assessment would be recommended for Mr. H if he still reported cognitive problems after intervention for his mood. With the patient’s consent, the delivery of recommendations and psychoeducation with a caregiver or family member present can be helpful.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec24"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par36">It is <span id="ITerm77">critical</span> to contextualize diagnostic interviewing procedures and interpretation in consideration of a patient’s cultural background and intersecting identities, including but not limited to age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability. Sociocultural factors shape the diagnostic interviewing process among older adults, and the interplay of clinician, patient, and institutional sociocultural contexts inherently influences the clinical encounter in explicit and implicit ways. Clinicians engaging in diagnostic interviewing with minoritized individuals should take steps to mitigate the exacerbation of clinician-patient power dynamics that can manifest. Part of this process involves cultivating an awareness of the sociocultural contexts of a given patient population. For example, generational and age-related factors should be considered. Some studies have shown that older adults can have greater difficulty in recognizing mental health symptoms due to conflating symptoms with the normal aging process (Malkin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). This can, in turn, contribute to pessimistic <span id="ITerm78">attitudes </span>about mental health treatment and its efficacy, and ultimately underutilization of mental health services (Malkin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Adding to this picture, literature has demonstrated that racial and ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ older adults may mistrust mental health providers; this mistrust is shaped by fear of and actual mistreatment, stereotypes, racism, transphobia, heterosexism, and other biases within the mental healthcare system encountered across a lifetime (Casanova-Perez et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Cultural and language differences between patients and clinicians can also contribute to difficulty understanding providers, a sense of not feeling understood, and feeling disrespected (Suite et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">Ageism is a sociocultural and interpersonal influence that must be considered when interviewing older adults. It is well-established that ageism (defined as age-related stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination) has adverse effects on the physical and mental health of older adults, worsening chronic health conditions and memory, and increasing rates of depression and hospitalizations (Allen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). <span id="ITerm79">Ageist</span> attitudes can be implicit or explicit and come in many forms in healthcare, including use of “elderspeak,” (e.g., talking to an older adult as if they are a child, oversimplifying information), assumptions about lack of independence, ignoring sexual health needs, or dismissing/underestimating health concerns. Clinicians working with older adults should take active steps to reduce ageism in their encounters, address and change approach when ageism occurs (e.g., in the form of an age-related microaggression), and advocate for their older adult patients when ageism is apparent across a healthcare team or setting.</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">Race and ethnicity can have <span id="ITerm80">unique </span>impacts on the aging process, with specific challenges experienced by minoritized racial and ethnic older adults (Trinh et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Racial and ethnic older adult populations often face health and healthcare disparities, including higher rates of unaddressed physical and mental health conditions and limited access to inclusive and quality services (Forrester et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Jimenez et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Such disparities have been shown to be influenced by minority stress factors, including discrimination across a lifetime, bias in institutions and clinicians, and income inequities (Lavingia et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The provision of an inclusive and culturally competent interview and related feedback should also consider cultural context around well-being and beliefs about mental health. For example, recent cross-cultural surveys illustrate that the relation of positive affect to age across the life-cycle varies markedly by world region and culture (Helliwell et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). In terms of beliefs about mental health, studies have found a common belief among Black, Asian, and Latinx older adult groups in the United States that mental illness originates from familial disruption (Jimenez et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). For Asian Americans and Latinx <span id="ITerm81">older </span>adults, this notion may be linked to migration and relocation, which can shape cultural dynamics and exert a profound impact on health perspectives and beliefs. Intergenerational and extended family support can significantly impact well-being, and the family environment can provide valuable context for understanding symptoms and functioning. It is thus imperative for clinicians to be mindful of racialized disparities in care, cross-cultural differences in influences on mental health, and ensure conclusions are holistically informed and culturally contextualized.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Older adults who hold a minoritized gender and/or sexual orientation are also likely to face significant mental health and healthcare disparities. LGBTQ+ <span id="ITerm82">individuals</span> are a rapidly growing segment of the older adult population, yet remain vulnerable to experienced and anticipated forms of discrimination, victimization with violence, microaggressions, and internalized cisheternormativity (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>; Preston, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). LGBTQ+ racial and ethnic minority older adults in particular experience exclusion, isolation, and diminished social support within the LGBTQ+ community, <span id="ITerm83">due</span> to the dominance of a White and youth-focused culture (Chen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Similarly, trans LGBTQ older adults face a myriad of unique concerns with aging. Data from the Trans Metlife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals, one of the largest databases of its kind, has illustrated that trans people of color and those living with disability have many concerns regarding aging, including anticipated discrimination, loss of control, and poor quality of life, particularly related to receipt or not of gender affirming care (Walker et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Overall, studies have shown that many LGBTQ+ people experience fears of anticipated mistreatment or marginalization as they age, particularly with regard to institutions or providers being biased and non-inclusive (Casanova-Perez et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Clinicians conducting diagnostic interviewing should also be aware of the unique stressors that may be faced by minoritized individuals and consider this in conclusions and recommendations.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec25"><h3 class="Heading">Sociocultural Considerations in Diagnostic Interviewing</h3><p class="Para" id="Par41">The diverse <span id="ITerm84">health</span> and aging needs of older adults can be addressed through cultural competency and cultural humility practices and training of healthcare professionals to reduce stigma and discrimination to <span id="ITerm85">practice</span> effective healthcare. <span id="ITerm86">Cultural competence</span> can involve gaining knowledge about the needs, experiences, and preferences of particular communities a clinician is likely to encounter. While greater knowledge of a particular group can help to increase understanding of certain experiences, including discrimination and victimization, it is important to avoid stereotyping and consider intersecting identities that contribute to unique individualized experiences of older adults (Trinh et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). In some ways, this very chapter could be considered as having a framing of cultural competence in describing the unique considerations for conducting interviews with older adults broadly. This approach has been critiqued for obscuring intersectionality and implying that a clinician can reach a level of “knowing” about a given community or cultural group. Thus, <span id="ITerm87">cultural humility</span>, an ongoing process of clinicians reflecting <span id="ITerm88">on</span> their own identities, values, and biases and how these impact, intersect, and interact with patient identities and experiences (Tervalon &amp; Murray-García, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR59" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>), is also necessary. The combination of these approaches to multicultural practice can offer an approach to mitigating disparities experienced by older adults in mental healthcare, at least on a clinician level (Greene-Moton &amp; Minkler, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). In establishing rapport with patients via empathy and openness, it is also essential to ensure that language barriers are addressed to facilitate communication. Language difficulties between patients and providers can lead to inaccurate and inadequate evaluations and misdiagnosis and further contribute to healthcare disparities (Llorente &amp; Valverde, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>); thus, interpretation through bilingual staff, medical interpreters, qualified translators, friends and family members, and telephone/telehealth interpreter services may assist the interview process. Further, organizations, hospitals, and healthcare settings should work at an institutional level to increase recruitment and retention of diverse <span id="ITerm89">clinicians</span> and uphold cultural <span id="ITerm90">competency</span> trainings (Greene-Moton &amp; Minkler, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p></section>
</section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec26"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par42">In addition to maintaining a multicultural framework, there are several key areas that must be considered in order to develop an informed understanding, diagnosis, and recommendations when assessing an older adult. Though these factors are not necessarily unique to older adults, they increase in importance in later life and include: careful assessment of the patient’s medical context and medications, their cognitive functioning, influences on psychiatric diagnoses, and consideration of life circumstances.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec27"><h3 class="Heading">Medical Conditions and Medication Side Effects</h3><p class="Para" id="Par43">Multimorbidity and <span id="ITerm91">polypharmacy</span> are highly prevalent among older adults. Physical illnesses and injuries that cause chronic pain may interfere with one’s ability to focus, as well as learn and retain information. Fatigue, loss of interest, and cognitive dysfunction are common among individuals with autoimmune conditions such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Pryce &amp; Fontana, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Cancer and side effects from its treatments also commonly cause somatic symptoms of depression, including appetite or weight loss, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and diminished concentration (Saracino &amp; Nelson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Identifying an underlying physical illness causing depression-like symptoms can be a challenge for clinicians. Although there is no single test that can differentiate depression caused by psychiatric illness from a medical condition masquerading as <span id="ITerm92">depression</span>, clinicians should assess for features uncharacteristic of a true depressive disorder and confer with the patient’s physician to obtain laboratory testing when possible. Furthermore, mental health professionals may often encounter patients experiencing depression as a psychological reaction to their non-psychiatric medical illness. Depression rates are elevated among individuals with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Agustini et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Depressive symptoms in patients with these conditions could be viewed as natural reactions to the pain, medical costs, burdensome self-management regimens, and functional impairment associated with these illnesses. Because many physical illnesses are more common in late life, it is particularly important for clinicians to take these stressors into account when evaluating older patients.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">With this increase in medical <span id="ITerm93"/>comorbidities, there is a risk for polypharmacy (i.e., combinations of medications that may interact or may be unneeded) and adverse events, including delirium (Liang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Polypharmacy has been associated with cognitive decline in older adult (Wastesson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>) with psychotropic (e.g., benzodiazepines) and anticholinergic medications (e.g., Benadryl) having particularly strong associations with reversible cognitive impairment (Wastesson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Furthermore, chemotherapy agents, anti-hypertensives (beta-blockers), steroids (e.g. Prednisone), and opiates/narcotic analgesics can also <span id="ITerm94">adversely</span> affect cognitive function.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec28"><h3 class="Heading">Cognitive Functioning</h3><p class="Para" id="Par45"><span id="ITerm95">Cognitive functioning</span><span id="ITerm96"/> is an important concern that can impact quality of life and affect one’s ability to live independently. While some modest cognitive changes can occur in later life due to normal aging (e.g., decreased speed of processing, difficulty with divided attention, decreased mental flexibility/abstraction), most older adults do not develop cognitive decline that significantly impacts functioning (Lighthall et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Older adults with normal age-related changes are able to perform daily activities and maintain independence. They are also likely to be aware of their cognitive changes and can compensate for them. Conversely, individuals with dementia are more likely to have limited awareness and insight into their decline in intellectual functioning (Arvanitakis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Furthermore, behavioral and emotional symptoms, such as agitation, suspiciousness, apathy, and personality changes, may accompany the cognitive decline seen in older adults with <span id="ITerm97">dementia </span><span id="ITerm98"/>but are typically not observed in people with normal age-related cognitive changes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">More notable cognitive decline occurs in adults with dementia, otherwise known as major neurocognitive disorder. Dementia affects 57.4 million adults worldwide and is projected to become substantially more prevalent over the next several decades due to population growth and extended lifespans (GBD 2019 Dementia Forecasting Collaborators, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Major neurocognitive disorder is characterized by non-acute decline in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, recognition, executive functioning, language, and/or motor skills, representing a change from previous functioning and severe enough to interfere with daily life. The most common etiological subtypes are Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia (Arvanitakis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). A key feature of dementia is significant interference with occupational or social functioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47"><span id="ITerm99">Mild cognitive impairment/minor neurocognitive disorder (MCI)</span>, <span id="ITerm100"/><span id="ITerm101"/>sometimes a precursor to dementia, is characterized by modest cognitive decline in one or more domains, but these deficits do not interfere with one’s ability to be independent (Manly et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). MCI represents a stage between normal age-related cognitive changes and more severe cognitive decline seen in dementia. Unlike adults experiencing normal age-related cognitive changes, those experiencing MCI may experience difficulties in executive functioning or difficulty learning new information, and such problems may be due to a reversible medical condition or medication side effect. Diagnosing these issues should involve a clinical interview, and bloodwork, possibly supplemented by neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Older adults with MCI may be advised to get neuropsychological testing on an annual basis to track changes in cognitive functioning, as <span id="ITerm102">MCI </span>can be indicative of early signs of dementia and develop further.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">Delirium can also be present in older adults with more acute medical conditions and is important to differentiate from a more pervasive neurocognitive issue. In contrast to <span id="ITerm103">MCI</span> or dementia, delirium is a temporary state characterized by marked changes in alertness and attention, consequent global cognitive changes, <span id="ITerm104"/><span id="ITerm105"/>fluctuating presenting symptoms, and associated features including an alteration in the sleep-wake cycle. Unlike dementia, which has a gradual onset and is generally chronic, delirium is acute, potentially developing over the course of a few hours or days, and is often treatable when the underlying medical cause is detected (Liang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Importantly, hypoactive, as opposed to hyperactive delirium, is often underrecognized in older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment or physical limitations, and may also be mistaken for depressed mood (Anand &amp; MacLullich, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Risk factors include dementia, frailty, taking multiple psychoactive medications, serious illness, and significant routine changes. Acute medical causes of delirium <span id="ITerm106"/><span id="ITerm107"/>include viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, brain injury, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, dehydration, vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12 or thiamine), sleep deprivation, withdrawal from drugs or alcohol, organ failure, and psychoactive medications (e.g., opiates or benzodiazepines) can cause delirium. Mental health clinicians may assist a team in detecting delirium in conjunction with a medical workup. Treatment is centered on addressing the underlying cause of delirium and may <span id="ITerm108"/><span id="ITerm109"/>include deprescribing medications.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec29"><h3 class="Heading">Psychiatric Diagnostic Categories and Considerations for Older Adults</h3><p class="Para" id="Par49">The identification of <span id="ITerm110">psychiatric diagnoses</span> in older adults should bear in mind several considerations, including risk and protective factors, symptom presentation, and reporting bias. With regard to risk and protective factors, both are highly contextual and depend on an older adult’s individual, familial, and cultural circumstances. However, examples can include older adults being at greater risk for changes in key roles in life (e.g., becoming a caregiver to a partner), developing medical illness that impacts functioning, or financial insecurity. On the other hand, older adults may also experience protective factors such as greater self-concept, multigenerational social supports, or engagement in meaningful activities and roles.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">Presentation of <span id="ITerm111">various</span> DSM-5-TR syndromes may differ in older adults based on risk and protective factors, including life circumstances, comorbidities, and age of onset. Clinically significant depressive symptoms that do not meet DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode are common in older adults. Depression in older adults may be more likely to manifest as withdrawal, apathy, and anhedonia, as opposed to affective symptoms like “sadness” (Krishnamoorthy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Further, definitions of what it means to be depressed might differ by cohort. Bereavement is prevalent among older adults, and may be confused by a provider with symptoms of major depression (Boelen &amp; Lenferink, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). The clinical <span id="ITerm112">manifestation</span> of anxiety in older adults may also differ from that of younger adults. In particular, anxiety symptoms in older adults are frequently misattributed to medical causes and limited insight (Jacobs &amp; Bamonti, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Similarly, ageist stereotypes may contribute to viewing the avoidance of social activities as normative rather than a symptom of depression or anxiety. It is important that clinicians conducting diagnostic interviewing with older adults work to build rapport, maintain cultural humility, and consider <span id="ITerm113">the</span> various influences on the older adult and their presentation.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec30"><h3 class="Heading">Life Stressors Common in Older Adulthood</h3><p class="Para" id="Par51">Concurrent <span id="ITerm114">life stressors</span> are always important to consider in thorough assessment and, in the case of older adults, certain changes and related stressors may be more common than in younger groups. These include retirement, divorce, bereavement, or moving to assisted living or institutional residential settings. Changed circumstances can produce a sense of instability that can impact older adults with cognitive impairment or pre-existing mental health concerns. In the wake of significant life transitions, an older adult may face challenges to their sense of identity and purpose, changes in meaningful activities and roles, grief, and social impacts (Kellehear &amp; Garrido, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Such challenges can paradoxically come with new possibilities and an increased urgency to engage in creating a life of meaning that may conflict with limitations such as financial insecurity or chronic illness and result in increased distress.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">Bereavement may <span id="ITerm115"/>be used as an example in that it presents particularly unique challenges in terms of diagnostic interviewing. The death of significant others (e.g., spouse/partner, sibling, friends, adult children) is an inevitable part of aging, and losses may accumulate over time. Though most bereaved individuals will adapt to loss, a subset may be at risk for developing bereavement-related mental health challenges, including prolonged grief disorder, major depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR52" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). This is particularly the case if the bereaved older adult is socially isolated, disconnected from sources of meaning, or experiences multiple concurrent losses. Furthermore, bereavement reactions can be complicated by and trigger cognitive and physical decline. When assessing older adults, caution should be taken to not pathologize grief reactions in the acutely bereaved, yet to also explore to what extent functioning <span id="ITerm116">is</span> impacted by bereavement as a significant stressor. Additional information on bereavement-related disorders can be found in (Boelen &amp; Lenferink, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">Taken together, medical and cognitive comorbidities, unique risk and protective factors in older adults for psychiatric diagnoses, and life events that may be more likely to occur (and occur in succession) in older adults may all have an impact on their symptom presentation, the interview process, and diagnostic conclusions. Culturally responsive, multimethod assessment offers a useful avenue for addressing and integrating <span id="ITerm117">these</span> considerations (Dixon et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec32"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par68">Throughout this chapter, we have described the unique considerations, experiences, and needs of older adults that may be relevant to the conducting of a mental health diagnostic interview. Critical components include engaging in multimethod assessment, considering medical and cognitive contexts, and bearing in mind diversity and cultural contexts in older adults, specifically the presence of and potential impact of ageism. Given the heightened likelihood of chronic medical issues in older adults, clinicians should be prepared to review medical information, including current medication use, and consult and collaborate with medical providers when appropriate consent is obtained. Recommendations may similarly move beyond the psychological domain and include guidance for further consultation with a medical provider (e.g., neurologists). Overall, quality, informed diagnostic interviewing with older adults involves holding space for the potential ways in which the circumstances of older adults may differ from other lifespan periods while also not making age-related assumptions that overlook individual difference or perpetuate bias. Clinicians must acknowledge and promote the protective factors (e.g., social supports, meaningful activities, positive self-concept) that may buoy an older adult through challenging times as well as recognize the risk factors that may contribute to an older adult experiencing a mental disorder.</p></section>
