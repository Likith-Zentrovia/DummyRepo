Individuals with bipolar disorder experience marked impairments in occupational and interpersonal functioning, and these difficulties have been shown to persist despite clinical remission in approximately half of the diagnosed population (Sanchez-Moreno et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR79" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). Indeed, bipolar disorder ranks as the overall ninth leading cause of disability worldwide (World Health Organization, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR98" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>) and the sixth leading cause of disability in individuals aged 10 to 24 years worldwide (Gore et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). Most patients with bipolar disorder will have at least one other comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, with anxiety disorders, substance use <span id="ITerm1">disorders</span>, personality disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders being highly prevalent (Krishnan, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR01" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). The presence of comorbid psychiatric <span id="ITerm2">diagnoses</span> can contribute to poorer illness outcomes (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Bauer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>), and the use of substances can intensify manic symptoms (Rowland &amp; Marwaha, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR77" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). <span id="ITerm3">Bipolar disorder</span> is also associated with a higher prevalence of medical conditions, often leading to premature mortality (Chan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Rates of death by suicide among <span id="ITerm4">individuals</span> with bipolar disorder are between 30 and 60 times that of the general population (Miller &amp; Black, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Of those individuals diagnosed with <span id="ITerm5">bipolar disorder</span>, 25–50% will attempt suicide within their lifetime (Baldessarini et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Dong et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Jamison, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>) and 15–20% of individuals with bipolar disorder will die by suicide, with a greater risk of death in individuals that have untreated bipolar disorder (Baldessarini et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Dome et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>; Dong et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Individuals with bipolar II are at a higher risk of suicide than those diagnosed with bipolar I (Plans et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). There are no significant differences in the prevalence of suicidal ideation between males and females with bipolar disorder (Hu et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>), but lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts is higher in females than males (Dong et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Tondo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR89" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) and higher in rapid cycling bipolar disorder than non-rapid cycling bipolar disorder (Dong et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Despite a higher prevalence of suicide attempts in <span id="ITerm6">females</span>, males with bipolar disorder exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of suicide-related deaths (Hu et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>) as men with bipolar often use more lethal means of suicide (Tondo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR89" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Pompili et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR74" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). Several additional demographic and socioeconomic-related factors are associated with increased rates of completed suicide among people with bipolar disorder including being White, being divorced, living alone, and being under age 35 or over age 75 (Plans et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Additionally, individuals who experience bipolar disorder onset at a younger age are at an increased risk of a future suicide attempt (Schaffer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR80" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par4"><span id="ITerm7">Bipolar disorder</span> has a strong genetic component (Chen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>), but environmental influences such as stress or trauma may impact illness onset and severity (Aldinger &amp; Schulze, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Stressful life events that can contribute to bipolar disorder onset or course include childbirth, divorce, unemployment, or loss of a parent early in life (Rowland &amp; Marwaha, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR77" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). In addition to the connection between stressful life events and the lifetime development of bipolar disorder, 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder report at least one stressful event before a manic or depressive episode in the past 6 months, further suggesting the strong role that stress plays in the development and manifestation of bipolar disorder and related episodes (Rybakowski, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR78" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">Between 20 and 30% of patients with major depressive disorder transition to bipolar disorder within 3 years. Because of this, it is imperative that clinicians are acutely aware of the possibility of this transition (Kessing et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>; McIntyre et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). The DSM-5 Text Revision (TR) includes the following seven diagnoses under the category of Bipolar and Related Disorders: bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading">Bipolar I Disorder</h3><div class="Para" id="Par6">To receive a DSM-5 TR diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, the patient must meet the criteria for a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">manic episode</em>, which is a distinct period of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy. Symptoms can include increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation; decreased need for sleep; inflated self-esteem; pressured speech; racing thoughts; distractibility; or engagement in risky activities, such as reckless spending or sexual <span id="ITerm8">indiscretions</span> (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Manic irritability can be differentiated from depressive irritability in that it may involve feelings that others are moving too slowly to keep up with the patient’s fast-paced thoughts, or that others are serving as obstacles in the way of the patient’s plans. This period must be present for most of the day, nearly every day, last for at least 1 week, and result in significant impairment or negative consequences, although all episodes involving hospitalization meet criteria for mania regardless of length, presumably due to their severity. Manic episodes must also include at least three additional symptoms, such as increased grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, and racing thoughts (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">7.1</a></span>); four symptoms are required if the patient presents with irritable mood only.<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 7.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Diagnostic features for manic and hypomanic <span id="ITerm9">episodes</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Manic episode</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Hypomanic episode</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">A.

Manic episodes must also cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or involve psychotic features or <span id="ITerm10">hospitalization</span>. Psychosis during mania may involve religious or grandiose delusions, such as that the individual is invincible or has special powers. Importantly, while bipolar I disorder is often characterized by a history of both manic and major depressive episodes, the experience of depressive episodes is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not required</em> to receive a bipolar I diagnosis. That being said, mania-only bipolar disorder is relatively rare, accounting for 5 to 28% of bipolar diagnoses based on various estimates (Perugi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR71" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). To diagnose bipolar I disorder, the clinician must confirm that the manic episode is not better attributed to a schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">The lifetime prevalence rate for <span id="ITerm11">bipolar I disorder</span> has been estimated at approximately 1% in the United States (Clemente et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>) and up to 2.4% globally (Merikangas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). These rates are approximately equivalent between men and women (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Merikangas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). The mean age of onset reported in the literature ranges from 18 to 25 years old with a smaller subset of the population being diagnosed in midlife (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Sentissi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR81" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Differences have been identified between these two subgroups, such that earlier age of onset is associated with greater illness severity, family history of bipolar disorder, and increased risk of suicide attempts compared to those in the older onset group (Sherazi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR85" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Bipolar II Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par9"><span id="ITerm12">Bipolar II disorder</span> is characterized by the presence of both <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">hypomanic episodes</em> and major depressive episodes. Hypomanic episodes differ from manic episodes in their severity and may differ in their length as well. Specifically, hypomania is characterized by at least four consecutive days of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood along with increased activity or energy and three additional symptoms (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">7.1</a></span>), or four symptoms if presenting with irritable mood only. Hypomanic episodes involve an unequivocal, uncharacteristic, and observable change in functioning in the patient, but not to the point of causing marked impairment or necessitating hospitalization. However, individuals with bipolar II disorder must have a history of at least one major depressive episode. Individuals with bipolar II disorder are more likely to present to treatment during a depressive episode versus a period of hypomania; given the lack of impairment associated with hypomania, they often do not find fault with these symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">It is important to note that bipolar II disorder is not a milder version of bipolar I disorder. While individuals with <span id="ITerm13">bipolar II disorder</span> do not experience the impairment of mania, they often experience longer and more frequent depressive episodes as compared to bipolar I, which significantly impacts functioning (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Indeed, the functional impairment observed in bipolar disorder has largely been attributed to the experience of depressive symptoms versus manic or hypomanic symptoms (Bauer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>). Like bipolar I, diagnosing bipolar II requires that the hypomanic and major depressive episodes are not better attributed to schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">The lifetime prevalence of bipolar II disorder is 0.4% (Merikangas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) to 1.57% (Clemente et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). The average age of onset is during the mid-20s and is somewhat later than that observed in bipolar I <span id="ITerm14">disorder</span>. Bipolar II may be more prevalent in females than males (Diflorio &amp; Jones, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Major depressive episodes typically precede hypomania in those ultimately diagnosed with bipolar II disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). If an individual initially had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the diagnosis would convert to bipolar II disorder upon the experience of a hypomanic episode. Similarly, a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder would convert to bipolar I if a manic episode were to occur.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Cyclothymic Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par12"><span id="ITerm15">Cyclothymic disorder</span> is characterized by its chronicity and subthreshold hypomanic and depressive symptoms. This disorder requires at least a two-year period in which the individual has experienced numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode, and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not constitute a major depressive episode. The time length is shortened to at least 1 year of such patterning among children and adolescents. The individual cannot be symptom-free for more than two consecutive months and symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment. If an individual subsequently meets the criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar II disorder, or bipolar I disorder, the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is removed. The lifetime prevalence rate of cyclothymic disorder ranges from 0.4 to 2.5% (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Merikangas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) and is equally common among men and <span id="ITerm16">women</span>. The disorder is thought to typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood, and has a 15–50% likelihood of subsequently converting to bipolar I or II (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par13">Individuals who develop mood disturbances as a result of substance or medication use can receive a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. This condition is characterized by a prominent and persistent shift in affect that may be elevated, expansive, or irritable, and may be accompanied by increased energy or activity levels; the presence of depressed mood or anhedonia is not required to receive this diagnosis. It must be determined that the substance in question is capable of causing such mood effects and that the symptoms only emerged subsequent to the substance use.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14"><span id="ITerm17">Substances</span> that may lead to such effects include stimulants, steroids, and phencyclidine (PCP). Symptoms should not be better accounted for by a non-substance-related bipolar disorder and must cause clinically significant distress or impairment. Importantly, this diagnosis does not refer to hypomanic or manic symptoms resulting from the use of an antidepressant medication or electroconvulsive therapy. It must be confirmed that the emergence of hypomania and mania <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effects of these treatments</em> to be considered to represent “true” bipolar disorder and does not fall under the category of being substance or medication-induced. This change is consistent with research indicating that antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania is a highly specific indicator of subsequent spontaneous manic or hypomanic episodes, and therefore a conversion to a bipolar diagnosis, among those being treated for depression (Akiskal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a></span>; Ghaemi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>).</p></section>

Possible medical conditions that may result in this presentation include Cushing’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries. Symptoms occurring exclusively during periods of delirium do not qualify, nor do symptoms that predate the development of the medical condition in question.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par16">A diagnosis of other specified bipolar and related disorder may be used when the full criteria for any of the abovementioned disorders have not been met but the individual is experiencing clinically significant impairment or distress. Examples of circumstances in which this diagnosis is appropriate include the presence of: (1) major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes of less than 4 days, (2) major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes with fewer than three symptoms, (3) hypomanic episodes and no history of major depressive episodes, and (4) symptoms of cyclothymic disorder for less than 2 years in adults or less than 1 year in children or adolescents.</p></section>

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Specifiers</h3><p class="Para" id="Par18">A variety of specifiers may be added to a diagnosis to provide further detail regarding the patient’s presentation. The “with anxious distress” specifier can be used to characterize patients with at least two symptoms of anxiety occurring during a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. Co-occurring anxiety is associated with greater illness severity among individuals with bipolar <span id="ITerm18">disorders</span>. An indication of a manic or hypomanic episode “with mixed features” refers to the presence of at least three co-occurring depressive symptoms during the episode; a depressive episode with mixed features indicates the presence of at least three concurrent hypomanic or manic symptoms. The “with rapid cycling” specifier refers to the presence of at least four episodes of hypomania, mania, or major depression occurring within the past year. Rapid cycling may be more common in women, is associated with greater illness severity, and has a high prevalence in individuals with bipolar II (Miola et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">The “with melancholic features” specifier captures depressive episodes marked by a near-total loss of pleasurable feelings, while “with atypical features” refers to depressive episodes characterized by responsiveness to positive stimuli and increased appetite and sleep, among other symptoms. The “with mood-congruent psychotic features” or “with mood-incongruent psychotic features” <span id="ITerm19">specifier</span> can be applied when delusions or hallucinations are present within a manic or depressive episode (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>), and “with catatonia” can be specified when psychomotor immobility and lack of responsiveness to external stimuli are observed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">The “with peripartum onset” specifier is applied when the mood episode occurs either during pregnancy or in the first 4 weeks after delivery. The postpartum period is particularly high risk among women with bipolar disorders; they are 23–37 times more likely to have a psychiatric admission in the 30 days following birth compared to non-childbearing periods (Munk-Olsen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Sharma et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR83" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Peripartum mood episodes with psychotic features occur in between 0.1 and 0.2% of deliveries and are more likely among women with histories of prior peripartum mood episodes or prior mood <span id="ITerm20">disorder</span> diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Perry et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR70" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">The “with seasonal pattern” specifier can be applied if at least one type of episode tends to occur during a particular time of year for at least 2 years. The prototypical example of this specifier involves an onset of depression in the fall or winter that remits in the spring, although hypomania and mania may show seasonal patterns as well. The “with seasonal pattern” specifier is more common with bipolar II diagnoses compared to bipolar I (Fico et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). The “in partial remission” specifier is utilized if symptoms of an episode still remain but no longer meet full criteria for the episode, or if there have been no significant symptoms for a period of less than 2 months. The “in full remission specifier” is employed when there have been no significant symptoms of an episode for at least 2 months. Mild, moderate, and severe specifiers can indicate the number and severity of symptoms as well as the degree of impairment for both major depressive and manic episodes, although the definitions of the severity specifiers vary slightly based on whether it is a manic or depressive episode.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><p class="Para" id="Par22">The procedures for gathering information to determine a potential bipolar disorder diagnosis may vary considerably based on context, resources, time constraints, and the availability of additional informants such as family members or other providers. Ideally, this process will involve an in-person diagnostic interview conducted by a trained clinician who assesses for symptoms of bipolar or related disorders as per the DSM-5-TR (see the Recommendations for Formal Assessment section below for examples of diagnostic interview protocols). While the degree of structure within the interview may vary from an informal assessment to the use of a standardized protocol, it is always important to ask questions and respond to patients’ answers in an open, nonjudgmental, and easy-to-understand fashion. Providing opportunities for patients to describe their symptoms and concerns in their own words will allow for a better understanding of the diagnostic presentation, reinforcing that the patient’s personal experience is an invaluable component of the decision-making process.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">However, the interviewer should also anticipate that some patients may lack insight into the full extent of their symptoms and that more focused, close-ended questions are often necessary to gather the information needed to reach a diagnosis. This is particularly true when assessing for bipolar disorder, given that individuals with this diagnosis spend the majority of time in depressive episodes versus hypomanic or manic episodes and may be less likely to find their elevated mood states to be impairing (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>; American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Therefore, it is crucial to specifically screen for a history of hypomanic or manic symptoms regardless of the patient’s presenting concerns. An individual not assessed for these symptoms may receive an incorrect diagnosis of depression and initiate antidepressant medication; as noted above, antidepressants can trigger hypomanic or manic episodes among those with bipolar disorder, further underscoring the importance of thorough diagnostic assessment to prevent potentially harmful treatment recommendations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">The interview should thoroughly assess for current and past suicidality given the elevated risk of attempted and completed suicide within this population (Baldessarini et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Jamison, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>; Tondo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR90" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). This safety assessment should include assessing the patient for self-harm or harm to others, assessing the need for hospitalization, completing a validated suicide screening tool to assess for risk factors (e.g., current psychiatric conditions, recent biopsychosocial stressors, availability of lethal means, physical health conditions), assessing protective factors, and creating a crisis response/safety plan if needed (US Department of Veterans Affairs, US Department of Defense, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR91" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">Possible comorbid conditions such as anxiety and substance use disorders should also be assessed, as they frequently accompany bipolar disorder and may be causing additional impairment (Bauer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). It is important to consider additional factors that may influence the diagnostic impression, including recent stressors, prescription and recreational drug use, past history of psychotherapy or hospitalizations, and co-occurring medical conditions. Furthermore, the interviewer should be attuned to behavioral cues that may inform the diagnostic picture, including the patient’s affect, rate of speech, quality of eye contact, psychomotor functioning, and personal hygiene. Slowed speech and movement, poor hygiene, and restricted eye contact may be indicators of a possible depressive episode, whereas pressured speech and psychomotor agitation may be signs of hypomania or mania. Examination of prodromal symptoms (e.g., excessive talking or energy, irritable mood, or racing thoughts) is important in the identification of first or recurrent manic episodes (Faedda et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>) and can best be assessed via a structured interview (Alvarez-Cadenas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">Important information can be gained from additional informants, such as the patient’s significant other, family members, or medical providers including primary care doctors or emergency department staff. Collecting this important information from those closest to the patient can provide valuable insights into a patient’s functioning and help increase diagnostic certainty (Vöhringer &amp; Perlis, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR92" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The assessor should verify whether informed consent is needed by the patient to discuss their functioning with an additional party. As individuals with bipolar disorders may be less likely to report impairment associated with hypomania or mania, observations of outside informants can be particularly helpful in identifying periods of distinct mood changes or unusual, erratic behaviors that may ultimately qualify as hypomanic or manic episodes (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">Ideally, the provider will be able to gather information from multiple sources (e.g., the patient and his or her significant other or spouse) and through various formats (e.g., interview, behavioral observation, and self-report questionnaires) to provide the most comprehensive assessment of the patient and his or her presenting concerns. However, time constraints or situational factors may preclude a thorough in-person interview. In such circumstances, it may be indicated to complete a brief structured screening measure, either administered by the provider or as a self-report questionnaire (see Recommendations for Formal Assessment section for examples), followed by a more comprehensive assessment interview if the patient screens positive.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Routine screening for bipolar disorder in the general population is not recommended, especially in the primary care setting, as it may lead to high rates of false positive diagnoses. However, screening using a validated screening tool is recommended when there is suspicion of bipolar disorder (e.g., depressive or manic symptoms present) during a clinical interaction with a patient. The goal of screening tools is to aid in the decision of whether to continue pursuing a bipolar diagnosis. Additional factors to be considered as relevant to pursuing a diagnosis of bipolar disorder include: a first-degree relative with diagnosed bipolar disorder, severe initial onset of depression under the age of 25 or multiple prior episodes of depression, comorbid anxiety/substance use/depression with psychotic features, treatment-resistant depression, and dysregulated sleep patterns (US Department of Veterans Affairs, US Department of Defense, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR91" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Regardless of the measures used, efforts should be made to inform the patient of the purpose and goals of the assessment. The patient should be encouraged to ask questions and voice any concerns they may have in completing this process. Taking a collaborative stance and establishing good rapport are important to both ensure a successful assessment process as well as to create a strong foundation for future clinical work. Even if the assessor will not be providing subsequent clinical care to the patient, they serve as a representation of their field and can have a major influence on the patient’s willingness to engage in treatment.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec11"><h2 class="Heading">Recommendations for Formal Assessment</h2><div class="Para" id="Par30">The use of formalized assessment tools ensures that the provider assesses symptoms in a structured, standardized, and comprehensive manner; providers who forgo formal assessment procedures for more unstructured approaches may be less likely to detect the presence of co-occurring disorders (Zimmerman &amp; Mattia, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR100" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a></span>). The standardized format of these tools provides reliability in the diagnostic process across patients, in addition to allowing the provider to track changes in an individual patient’s symptoms over time.

Semi-structured interviews, as their name suggests, include a <span id="ITerm22">standardized</span>, structured set of questions assessing the symptoms of psychological disorders, but provide flexibility such that the interviewer can “stray from the script” and ask clarifying questions or request examples as needed to determine whether diagnostic criteria are fully met. The structure of these interviews is designed to streamline the assessment process while also ensuring that all relevant information is gathered. For instance, if a patient denies any history of low mood, the interviewer may be able to “skip out” of the more comprehensive depression module; if a patient endorses manic symptoms, the interviewer may be prompted to ask more detailed questions <span id="ITerm23">regarding</span> the extent of impairment and the duration of recent episodes. The semi-structured interviews discussed in this chapter include the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID).</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">The SADS (Endicott &amp; Spitzer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a></span>) was designed to assess for the presence of psychiatric disorders based on the <span id="ITerm24">Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC)</span>, a standardized diagnostic system with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria that predated DSM-III (Rogers et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>; Spitzer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR87" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a></span>). The SADS is available in three versions; its standard form assesses for current and lifetime symptoms in separate sections, while the SADS-L (lifetime) probes for current and lifetime symptoms concurrently, and the SADS-C (change) assesses for change in patient functioning since the previous assessment (Endicott &amp; Spitzer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a></span>). The SADS is divided into disorder-specific modules that assess for the presence, severity, and duration of symptoms necessary to reach a diagnosis, in addition to modules that gather medical, social, and treatment histories. Test-retest reliability between experienced psychiatrists using the SADS-L was 0.83 for manic episodes, 0.72 for hypomanic episodes, and 1.0 for major depressive episodes (Simpson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR86" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>). The SADS has demonstrated strong reliability and validity in a review of 21 studies and is particularly sensitive in identifying mood disorder diagnoses (Rogers et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). Research on the SADS has lagged over the past two decades, however.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">The SCID was initially developed as a standardized tool to diagnose mental disorders based on DSM-III criteria (Spitzer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR88" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a></span>). It therefore has undergone multiple iterations as new versions of the DSM have been released and is currently updated to reflect the criteria of DSM-5—but a version incorporating the DSM-5-TR has not yet been published. The SCID for DSM-5 is available in both a researcher and clinician version (First et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2015a</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2015b</a></span>); the researcher version provides the most comprehensive assessment of disorders and specifiers, while the clinician version is abbreviated to focus on the most common diagnoses encountered in clinical settings. The SCID also offers an electronic version, NetSCID-5, that can be accessed through any internet-connected device and allows for data to be stored in HIPAA-compliant databases and downloaded to statistical software <span id="ITerm25">programs</span>. A validation study demonstrated that using this computerized version decreased the number of errors in interview administration as compared to those completing the paper version of the SCID (Brodey et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The interview is divided into disorder-specific modules that utilize a decision-tree format to determine if the patient meets DSM criteria for a given condition. In addition to assessing the range of mental disorders, the SCID gathers information regarding medical, social, and treatment history. Depending on the version used, diagnostic complexity, and the patient’s reporting style, the SCID is estimated to take between 30 and 180 min to administer.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">The SCID for DSM-5 Clinical Version shows strong psychometric properties. This validated tool was found to have strong specificity for bipolar disorder (95% for bipolar I, 100% for bipolar II, and 89%–96% for any bipolar disorder) with a sensitivity between 0.90 and 1.00 and high test-retest validity (1.00) (Osório et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR69" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>; Shabani et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR82" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>) indicating high levels of agreement between interviewers. However, reliability data are hard to obtain within community samples given the low base rate of bipolar disorder in the general population (Williams et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR95" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a></span>). It is important to note that diagnostic reliability is higher when the patient’s presentation is more severe, such as mania with psychotic features, as opposed to more subtle hypomanic symptoms (Akiskal &amp; Benazzi, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>; Dunner &amp; Tay, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a></span>; First &amp; Gibbon, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). SCID reliability was not found to vary based on the clinical training background of the interviewer (e.g., psychiatrist vs. social worker; First &amp; Gibbon, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading">Structured Interviews</h3><p class="Para" id="Par35"><span id="ITerm26">Structured interviews</span> comprise a fully standardized set of close-ended questions that do not require the clinical judgment of the interviewer to determine whether additional probes or examples are necessary. They can be administered by non-specialists and allow for direct comparisons across patients. While often used in large epidemiological research <span id="ITerm27">studies</span>, these tools can also have value within clinical settings by providing relatively straightforward, comprehensive, and standardized diagnostic assessments.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">The Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI; Kessler &amp; Ustun, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>) is a fully structured interview developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-IV-TR and International Classification of Diseases criteria (ICD-10; World Health Organization, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR97" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a></span>). The CIDI has not yet been updated to reflect changes in the DSM-5. Individuals from clinical and non-clinical backgrounds alike can be trained in administering the CIDI through <span id="ITerm28">computerized</span> or in-person trainings (Kessler &amp; Ustun, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). The CIDI contains 41 sections assessing a range of psychiatric disorders as well as physical comorbidities, suicidality, overall functioning and distress, and socio-demographic information. The interview is available in paper and computerized formats, takes approximately 2 h to <span id="ITerm29">complete</span>, and utilizes algorithms to determine diagnoses. An earlier review of the test-retest reliability of the CIDI demonstrated relatively low agreement rates (bipolar I; 0.61, bipolar II, 0.59; Wittchen, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR96" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a></span>), but a subsequent examination found that the concordance of bipolar I diagnoses obtained by the CIDI as compared to the SCID was relatively high (0.88; Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Differentiating between bipolar II and subthreshold bipolar disorder proved more problematic due to inconsistencies in disorder criteria between measures, but reliability was high when lumping these outcomes together (0.88; Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Hergueta et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>; Lecrubier et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR51" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>), as its name suggests, was developed as a shorter alternative to existing structured diagnostic interviews. The MINI bears many similarities to the CIDI in its use of screening questions, decision trees, and algorithms to determine diagnoses. It was intended to be a brief, inexpensive <span id="ITerm30">measure</span> with high sensitivity and specificity that can be easily administered by clinicians or non-clinicians after 2–3 h of training. The MINI assesses for current diagnoses of 18 disorders as well as suicidality and takes approximately 15 min to complete. The MINI has shown good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (Rodrigues et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). The measure has shown fair concordance in diagnosing manic episodes with both the CIDI (0.65) and the SCID (0.67), and rates are notably higher in detecting major depressive episodes (CIDI: 0.73, SCID: 0.84; Lecrubier et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR51" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>; Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR84" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec14"><h3 class="Heading">Screening Measures</h3><p class="Para" id="Par38">In time-constrained situations, it may be indicated to utilize a screening measure, a very brief assessment of <span id="ITerm31">symptoms</span> administered by the clinician or completed by the patient in questionnaire format. These tools are convenient—for instance, the patient could complete a screening <span id="ITerm32">questionnaire</span> while in the waiting room prior to their appointment—and can detect whether more thorough assessment is needed. Screening measures can help to prevent inappropriate depression diagnoses and subsequent antidepressant prescriptions among those who may in reality meet the criteria for a bipolar disorder (Phelps &amp; Ghaemi, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR72" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). It must be emphasized that screening tools are never intended to determine <span id="ITerm33">diagnoses</span> in the absence of additional assessment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The creators of the CIDI have developed a brief, interviewer-administered screening for bipolar disorders made up of 12 questions derived from the larger interview (CIDI screening scale for bipolar disorder, CIDI-SC, BPD; Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). This screening tool was found to have high sensitivity, identifying between 67% and 96% of true cases of bipolar disorder, and high positive predictive validity, such that 31–52% of those who screened positive met the criteria for bipolar <span id="ITerm34">disorder</span> (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Similarly strong results were replicated in a subsequent follow-up study, demonstrating excellent concordance between the CIDI screener and SCID in determining bipolar diagnoses (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ; Hirschfeld et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>) is a self-report screening tool for bipolar disorders. It contains 13 items assessing for DSM-IV manic and hypomanic episodes, followed by additional items assessing for co-occurrence of symptoms as well as level of impairment. The MDQ takes approximately 5 min to complete and has demonstrated <span id="ITerm35">acceptable</span> test-retest reliability (Hirschfeld et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>). The sensitivity of the MDQ has demonstrated high sensitivity (80%) and sensitivity (70%) (Wang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR93" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Some variability, ranging from detecting 28% of cases in a community sample to 90% of those with bipolar I in a clinical sample, is seen with this measure depending on the setting. Indeed, the measure has generally proven stronger in detecting bipolar I disorder as compared to bipolar II, and performs better in clinical as opposed to community samples (Miller et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>; Hirschfeld et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>). However, some concerns <span id="ITerm36">remain</span> about using the MDQ for bipolar screening as research has shown that symptoms captured by the questionnaire are more related to general distress or psychopathology rather than hypomania or mania (Mundy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">The Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32; Angst et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>) was developed as a tool to better screen for bipolar II disorder, particularly among those with major depression, given previous research demonstrating the difficulty of detecting hypomanic symptoms during diagnostic <span id="ITerm37">assessment</span>. The primary 32 items assess behaviors, emotions, and thoughts implicated in hypomania; the scale also collects information regarding the duration of symptoms and others’ reactions to the patient’s behaviors. The psychometric properties of the HCL-32 have been evaluated in over 20 international studies, and the measure has demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting bipolar diagnoses (estimated at 82%) (Meyer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>; Wang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR93" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>) with moderate specificity at 57% (Wang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR93" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Sensitivity is particularly high among those with preexisting diagnoses of major depression (Meyer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). The measure has also shown good internal consistency and comparability across <span id="ITerm38">cultures</span>, although test-retest reliability rates have demonstrated discrepancies between studies (Meyer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). Both the MDQ and HCL-32 are available in many languages, possibly lessening equity concerns in comparison to other screening tools (Youngstrom et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR99" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). In individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder and being treated with antidepressants, a validated instrument such as the MDQ or HCL-32 should be used to assess for mania/hypomania (US Department of Veterans Affairs, US Department of Defense, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR91" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">An updated version of the HCL-32 was recently developed to assess hypomanic symptoms in individuals with a major depressive <span id="ITerm39">disorder</span> diagnosis: the HCL-33 (Feng et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR02" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The HCL-33 also includes a version for external rating (HCL-33-EA) to be used by close family members or friends of the patient. It has been found that the HCL-33-EA is more sensitive at differentiating bipolar from major depressive disorder, but the HCL-33 has a higher specificity (Wang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR94" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">Multiple other screening measures exist, including the General Behavior Inventory (GBI; Depue et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">1981</a></span>) and the Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (BSDS; Ghaemi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>) as well as a variety of tools intended to measure the severity of bipolar symptoms (see Miller et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). It is important to ensure that the measure being used has strong psychometric <span id="ITerm40">properties</span>, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability, as well as good sensitivity in identifying individuals with the disorder and specificity in detecting those who do not have the disorder. The low overall base rates of bipolar disorder within the population are thought to contribute to the variable effectiveness of screening tools in accurately identifying those who do, and do not, meet diagnostic criteria; as such, these tools may be more accurate when employed within clinical versus community samples. These weaknesses again emphasize that screening tools for bipolar disorder are not considered robust enough to be used in isolation when forming a diagnosis (Mitchell, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">The use of fully structured interviews and/or screening measures has pros and cons. Benefits of these tools include their entirely standardized procedure, the ability for non-clinicians to be <span id="ITerm41">trained</span> in administration and scoring, and often their shorter administration times. However, with the exception of the HCL-33-EA, they rely entirely on the patient’s self-report in determining diagnoses which can negatively impact validity, particularly among patients with poorer insight into their functioning. In the case of screening measures, additional assessment will be needed if it is indicated that a patient may meet diagnostic criteria. It is important to consider these tradeoffs when determining the proper assessment measure, or combination of measures, to use within a given context.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec15"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustrations</h2><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3 ParaTypeOverview" id="FPar1"><div class="Heading">Case Illustration 1: Andy</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par45">Andy is a 40-year-old Caucasian man presenting to an outpatient mental health clinic along with his wife Jane. Jane asked to join for the initial portion of the diagnostic assessment and Andy agreed. Andy presented as slightly disheveled, in wrinkled clothes with messy hair. He was noticeably fidgety, repetitively tapping his feet on the floor and shifting in his seat. When asked what brought him into the clinic, Andy spoke quickly and irritably, stating that he is “feeling good” and is frustrated to be “wasting time” at this appointment, but agreed to come in for an <span id="ITerm42">assessment</span> given his wife’s insistence. Jane shared that she is concerned that Andy’s mood is “too up,” that he is not getting enough sleep and that some of his ideas do not make sense. She reported that he has had multiple periods like this in the past and that he had been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist before they moved 6 months ago for Andy to start a new job as a graphic designer. Since moving, Andy stated that he did not need to continue treatment as he was feeling happy and motivated by his new position. Jane expressed being worried that Andy’s behaviors may end up costing him his job; she shared that he was placed on disciplinary probation for not submitting work on time and will be fired if his performance does not improve.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">The clinician thanked Jane for her input and then completed the SCID for DSM-5 with Andy alone. Andy endorsed a history of major depressive episodes beginning at age 20. He described having his “first real high” at 25 upon finishing a graduate program. He had trouble recalling the length of this period but described feeling highly creative, having a decreased need for sleep without feeling fatigued, and having unprotected sex with several strangers which he described as highly unusual for him, particularly as he was in a monogamous relationship at the time. He noted that this subsequently led to his relationship dissolving, which motivated him to see a psychiatrist. He reported being prescribed a mood stabilizer and noted having taken his medication regularly for the past 4 years. However, he chose to not refill his prescription upon moving, given improvements in his mood and his dislike of the medication’s side effects.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">With regard to his current functioning, Andy reported feeling “super up, but also edgy at the same time” for approximately the past 3 weeks. He endorsed decreased need for sleep (4 h per night versus his typical eight), and increased energy which he has been trying to “burn up” by biking several hours per day, when he previously had not used his bike in over a year. He described an increase in <span id="ITerm43">creativity</span>, particularly with regard to his work, and noted pulling multiple all-nighters drafting out plans to revamp the company’s overall vision and mission. He stated feeling “unstoppable…my ideas are flowing so much faster,” and reported with confidence that he will be promoted to head of the design department within the next month as he has “the most valuable mind in the company by far.” The clinician noted that he became tangential in his thinking at several times during the interview and needed to be redirected. He denied any current recreational or prescription drug use and did not report having any medical conditions. The clinician assessed for risk and Andy denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. Given the duration of Andy’s abnormally elevated and irritable mood, in combination with his heightened energy, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, and increased goal-directed activity, as well as the significant impairment these behaviors have had on his work functioning, Andy meets criteria for a current manic episode and therefore, bipolar I disorder.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3 ParaTypeOverview" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Case Illustration 2: Lisa</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par48">Lisa is a 25-year-old Hispanic female who reported experiencing depressed mood on a health history intake form administered at her initial primary care appointment at a community health center. She presented as withdrawn, with poor eye contact and slowed, quiet speech. Her primary care doctor recommended that she be evaluated by the center’s behavioral health clinic and Lisa agreed. She met with a prescribing clinician who completed a brief unstructured diagnostic interview confirming that Lisa met the criteria for major depressive disorder. Lisa described a history of experiencing periods of persistent low mood in which she had decreased appetite, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and anhedonia. These episodes typically lasted about 1 month and began in her teenage years. She described herself as always being a “moody person” but <span id="ITerm44">noted</span> that the periods have gotten worse in the past several years; she was having trouble getting out of bed, was skipping more of her college courses, and was often late to her part-time job. These difficulties were further exacerbated by symptoms of anxiety, particularly in social situations. While she noted always being introverted and having a small circle of friends, she reported becoming increasingly withdrawn from others and turning down social plans. Lisa declined psychotherapy services, explaining that her busy schedule made it too difficult to commit to sessions, but was amenable to initiating an SSRI to treat her symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">Several months later Lisa returned to the clinic for a follow-up appointment to monitor her response to the medication. Lisa’s affect was noticeably brighter and she met the clinician with a smile. When the clinician noted this change, Lisa agreed that she had been feeling “really bubbly” for the past several weeks. She described striking up conversations with classmates she had never talked to before and reported joining five clubs on campus, spanning a wide range of activities that she had no prior experience in. She reported that waking up, going to school, and working at her part-time job felt easy and that she was no longer tired at the end of the day; she also noted sleeping 2 h less than usual and feeling even more rested upon waking. Lisa spoke very quickly and was <span id="ITerm45">noticeably</span> talkative; when the clinician mentioned this, Lisa agreed, stating that her mother had made the same comment and that her thoughts felt “fast and hard to keep track of.” She went on to say that she and her mother got in a small fight last weekend over a lewd joke Lisa made at a family dinner that Lisa’s mother found to be inappropriate and uncharacteristic of her. Lisa denied any current substance use. The clinician had Lisa complete the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) and she screened positive for hypomania. The clinician then administered the bipolar disorder module of the SCID for DSM-5. This interview confirmed that she met the criteria for a hypomanic episode given her persistently elevated mood, talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, and decreased need for sleep, all of which were uncharacteristic of her and noticeable by others, but were not causing marked impairment. These symptoms were deemed to extend beyond the physiological effects of her antidepressant medication. Lisa endorsed having experienced several similar periods of lesser intensity about 1 year ago that lasted at most 2 days. She agreed that this was the longest and most intense period of elevated mood she has experienced. Given her history of major depressive episodes and current hypomanic episode, Lisa therefore meets the criteria for bipolar II disorder. While Lisa was hesitant to discontinue her antidepressant medication at first, explaining that she had never felt better, she ultimately agreed with her clinician that her behaviors were negatively affecting her relationships with others and her ability to focus on her schoolwork. They subsequently explored alternative treatment options.</p></div></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec16"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par50">Although rates of bipolar I disorder are roughly equivalent between men and women, rates of bipolar II disorder may be higher for women than men (Diflorio &amp; Jones, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Similar rates of diagnosis of bipolar disorders are found around the world (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; McGrath et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Age of onset is typically late adolescence to early adulthood although a smaller subset may develop bipolar disorders in midlife (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). More than 70% of individuals with <span id="ITerm46">bipolar disorders</span> present with symptoms before the age of 25 (Jain &amp; Mitra, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>; Moreno et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR65" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>) and the median age of onset of 20 years old worldwide (McGrath et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Due to the challenges of diagnosing bipolar disorder, it takes an average of 6–10 years after first contact with a provider for the diagnosis to be confirmed (Dagani et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>; Fritz et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) with some research showing up to 14 years passing before proper diagnosis (Drancourt et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Race may influence the appropriate diagnosis of bipolar disorders. A collection of research has demonstrated that Black patients with bipolar disorder are more likely to receive an incorrect diagnosis of schizophrenia as compared to other racial groups (Akinhanmi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>; Neighbors et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>); this effect was found to hold regardless of the race of the clinician (Neighbors et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">Multiple factors may contribute to this phenomenon. Black patients may be more likely to (1) demonstrate psychotic symptoms during manic episodes that are subsequently misconstrued as schizophrenia, (2) display paranoia-like symptoms that may in fact be realistic concerns regarding racist behaviors directed towards them, and (3) show blunted affect, a symptom of schizophrenia, due to cultural differences in the display of emotions or a sense of guardedness when interacting with a non-minority provider (Akinhanmi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Kennedy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>; Neighbors et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>). Regardless of the reasoning behind this phenomenon, it is important for the clinician to be cognizant of this reality when assessing for bipolar disorder, versus <span id="ITerm47">attempting</span> to be “color blind” and ignore any potential impacts of race and culture on a patient’s presentation and on a provider’s clinical judgment (Neighbors et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">Racial differences in the presentation of manic and depressive symptoms could also lead to a missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis among patients from groups that have been historically underrepresented or discriminated against (Li et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR52" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Additionally, considerable differences exist in manic and depressive sleep disturbances in Black individuals versus White individuals with bipolar I disorder, with Black individuals experiencing sleep disturbances attributed to manic and depressive <span id="ITerm48">episodes</span> at a higher rate than White individuals. Given poor sleep is a risk factor for mood episode recurrence (Gold &amp; Sylvia, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), addressing sleep symptoms early may result in improved health outcome disparities in underrepresented populations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Minority patients with bipolar disorder may have higher rates of comorbid substance abuse, homelessness, and involuntary hospitalizations when compared to White patients (Kilbourne et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). It has also been posited that structural and cultural barriers experienced by minority patients, including poor access to healthcare and stigma, may lead them to present to care in more severe states of impairment as they may wait longer to seek help (Hwang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Patients from differing cultures may tend to report distress in terms of somatic versus psychological symptoms, as has often been observed among Asian patients (Lin &amp; Cheung, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR53" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a></span>); this is <span id="ITerm49">important</span> for the assessor to keep in mind when evaluating whether a patient meets diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Having said that, while it is important for clinicians to be aware of these types of cultural dynamics, it is equally important to not make assumptions about a patient’s clinical presentation based on their perceived race or ethnicity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">The interviewer should take care when considering a patient’s religious beliefs and practices as they may or may not relate to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Religiosity and spirituality have been found to be protective factors that can provide effective coping strategies among those with a mental disorder (De Fazio et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>; Jackson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). However, religious themes often emerge in the context of hypomanic and manic episodes and therefore certain behaviors and beliefs may represent bipolar symptomatology. It is important for the assessor to differentiate between normative aspects of one’s religious beliefs and marked shifts in their thoughts and behaviors (Ouwehand <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR03" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). For instance, the interviewer can ask questions to determine whether the amount of time an individual reports praying or reading religious texts is markedly greater than at other times in the <span id="ITerm50">past</span>, whether the patient’s self-described feelings of transcendence or connection with God are significantly stronger or more intense than usually experienced, whether these feelings or behaviors are in marked contrast to their peers, and whether these shifts occurred in conjunction with the emergence of additional hypomanic or manic symptoms (Michalak et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR59" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Religious content can also be observed in the context of psychosis, including auditory hallucinations of God or spirits, beliefs of possession by the devil, or grandiose delusions of being a savior or God figure (Brewerton, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a></span>). As seeing or hearing <span id="ITerm51">God</span> or spirits is normative within certain belief systems, contextual factors must be strongly considered when determining the nature of a patient’s reported experiences.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec17"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par56">As discussed elsewhere, it is helpful to gather information from key informants when determining a bipolar diagnosis, such as family members or other healthcare providers involved in their care. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing bipolar disorders as patients may lack insight into the extent of impairment or change in behavior they are experiencing during manic or hypomanic episodes. Indeed, a diagnosis of hypomania requires that others have observed changes in mood and <span id="ITerm52">functioning</span>. Given the lack of marked impairment seen in bipolar II disorder and patients’ tendency to present in a depressive episode, it can be particularly difficult to identify a history of hypomanic episodes (Angst et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). However, this information is critical to determining an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, assessors should be sure to always assess for a history of hypomanic or manic symptoms when a patient presents with depression. Utilizing scales specific to the diagnosis of hypomania, such as the HCL-32, can be helpful in identifying more nuanced behaviors that may be indicative of bipolar II disorder, such as being more social or traveling more than usual. As detailed in the diagnostic criteria section, symptoms of mania and hypomania can be induced by certain recreational and prescription drugs as well as by certain medical conditions; therefore, it is very important to obtain a thorough medical history of the patient including any recent diagnoses or medication changes. Finally, given that bipolar disorder has a strong genetic component, it is helpful to gather a family history of psychiatric disorders that may inform the diagnostic process.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec19"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par58">Bipolar disorders are impairing and chronic conditions that require accurate diagnosis to ensure appropriate treatment and management. The assessor has the option of utilizing semi-structured interviews, structured assessments, or screening measures to aid in determining a bipolar diagnosis, and each method has unique pros and cons to consider depending on the patient, available resources, timing, and context. The input of key informants can also be crucial in arriving at an accurate diagnostic decision. Among the many considerations the assessor should keep in mind, it is always important to adequately explain the assessment procedure to the patient, allow opportunities for questions, and remain cognizant of cultural and contextual factors that may influence a patient’s presentation and diagnosis. A successful assessment procedure can both direct a patient to the appropriate avenues for treatment and serve as a positive introduction to the mental health care delivery system. Completing the diagnostic process in an informed, thoughtful, and thorough fashion is necessary to ensure the best level of care for patients with bipolar disorders.</p></section>
