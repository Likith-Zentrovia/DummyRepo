In addition to being common, anxiety disorders can be quite debilitating, contributing to comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, substance abuse, etc.) and dysfunction in many domains (e.g., marital dissatisfaction, academic and work underperformance, overutilization of medical services, etc.) (Baxter et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). Symptoms of these <span id="ITerm2">disorders</span> appear to be increasing in prevalence in recent years (Goodwin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), particularly since the COVID pandemic (Twenge &amp; Joiner, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Anxiety disorders carry an <span id="ITerm3">enormous</span> societal cost in the United States and globally (Baxter et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>; Konnopka &amp; König, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Fortunately, these disorders are relatively recognizable and treatable; there is a strong body of scientific literature to support effective assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders (Higa-McMillan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Van Dis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR65" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">The DSM and ICD frameworks upon which current mental health practice relies are typically viewed as atheoretical. However, they are quite compatible with an assessment of fear conditions using the behavioral method of functional assessment. Functional assessment attempts to reveal the function or <span id="ITerm4">purpose</span> of the problematic behaviors and symptoms and thereby provides the foundation for behavioral therapy using exposure.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Consistent with the view of assessment as potentially therapeutic (Finn, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR002" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), the diagnostic interview is an opportunity to work toward a collaborative understanding of the presenting problem. Diagnosis in the broad sense “goes on in the experience of the client, rather than” only “in the intellect of the clinician” (Rogers, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">1965</a></span>, p. 223). To the degree that the clinician has and communicates a useful conceptualization of the client’s presenting problem, the client has opportunities to develop an awareness of the factors that maintain the problem and to develop a conceptualization that supports new, adaptive behaviors (Pachankis &amp; Goldfried, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). That conceptualization is implicitly communicated by what the clinician pays attention to and what the clinician asks about. The potentially therapeutic value of the diagnostic interview is increased when the <span id="ITerm5">interviewer</span> is well-versed in a conceptualization of the problem that is useful for bringing about change. For this reason, interviewers are advised to have a facility with the behavioral model underlying exposure-based treatments of anxiety disorders.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">The behavioral approach offers a clear and compelling conceptualization regarding the functions of anxiety and avoidance and has led to the development of exposure-based treatments that are highly effective (e.g., Deacon &amp; Abramowitz, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>; Parker et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Although the DSM and ICD frameworks have been criticized on a number of grounds (Whooley, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), their compatibility with the behavioral approach makes these categorical diagnostic frameworks quite useful for working with anxiety disorders.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading">Behavioral Approach to Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par6">The behavioral approach to assessment, called functional assessment, is designed to reveal the function of the problematic responses and behaviors. <span id="ITerm6">Anxiety disorders</span> can be viewed as consisting of two components (Mowrer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">1951</a></span>): anxiety and <span id="ITerm7">avoidance</span>. The first component, anxiety, is viewed as a Pavlovian (aka classical or respondent) conditioned stimulus-response relationship. Fear responses are reflex-like phenomena that include physiological arousal (e.g., increased breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, etc.) and subjective distress. These responses are similar to other reflexive responses (e.g., salivation, pupil dilation, nausea, etc.) that are under the control of controlling stimuli (e.g., food, light, contamination, etc.). The <span id="ITerm8">controlling stimuli</span> are also called triggers or cues. Through processes such as classical conditioning, a new and different stimulus gains control of the reflex-like response. For Pavlov’s dogs, the pairing of the sound of a bell with food allowed the bell to develop control over the reflex-like response of salivation. Similar processes allow benign stimuli (e.g., the sight of a clown) to develop control of the reflex-like response found in anxiety disorders, i.e., fear responses. Classical conditioning provides a description of one way in which an individual might develop the stimulus-response association that is apparent in anxiety disorders.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">Fear, anxiety, and panic (i.e., fear responses) are normal, natural, and adaptive behaviors that are biologically based. Some stimuli (e.g., a visual cliff) may reliably lead to fear and anxiety without any prior learning. Other stimuli (e.g., driving a car) that are capable of evoking fear responses appear to have acquired the capacity to trigger fear responses through classical conditioning and secondary conditioning processes (e.g., modeling and informational learning). The function of fear responses is to motivate behavior that keeps the individual safe from harm.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">The second component of <span id="ITerm9">anxiety disorders</span> consists of avoidance and escape behaviors (Mowrer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">1951</a></span>). The behavioral perspective views fear responses not only as reflex-like responses that are triggered by controlling stimuli but also as stimuli in their own right. Because fear responses are often experienced as aversive, they motivate avoidance and escape. Behaviors that effectively reduce or prevent fear responses are negatively reinforced, a type of instrumental (aka operant) conditioning. The function of avoidance and escape behavior is that they prevent and/or reduce harm and the associated fear responses. A second consequence of avoidance and escape behaviors is that they inadvertently preclude experiences that can lead to new learning that could offset the stimulus-response associations in memory that underlie the first (respondent) component (Foa &amp; Kozak, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a></span>). The Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (i.e., ABC) model underlying functional assessment of the second component (i.e., the instrumental or operant component) views anxiety as the Antecedent (which is also the fear response from the stimulus-response component), avoidance and escape as the Behavior, and anxiety reduction or prevention as the Consequence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">In sum, the behavioral perspective views anxiety disorders as involving: (1) <span id="ITerm10">controlling stimuli</span>, (2) <span id="ITerm11">fear responses</span>, and (3) <span id="ITerm12">avoidance and escape behaviors</span>. Before describing the nuances of how these three elements are related to each of the anxiety disorders, it will be useful to identify a few terms.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Some Definitions</h3><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm13"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Controlling stimuli</em></span> include the objects and situations that evoke the fear responses and the subsequent escape and avoidance behaviors. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Fear responses</em> include panic attacks, fear, and anxiety. The term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">panic attack</em> is closely related to the evolutionary concept of the “fight-or-flight” response. Panic attacks are defined in the DSM as consisting of at least four symptoms from a list of 13 possible symptoms. Each of these symptoms can be viewed as facilitating an individual’s capacity to adaptively respond to imminent physical danger, or as a consequence of that adaptive response. For example, an individual might experience “palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate” because increased blood flow provides the major muscles with oxygen and other nutrients needed to engage in vigorous action; “sweating” as part of the body’s anticipation of the increased temperature associated with fighting or fleeing; “paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensation),” and “chills or hot flushes” as by-products of the vasoconstriction associated with diverting blood flow away from body parts that are not essential for fight-or-flight; and so on. The DSM criteria for panic attacks also specify that the symptoms begin abruptly, that is, reaching a peak within 10 min. Viewing panic attacks as activations of the fight-or-flight response is compatible with the view that these physiological processes are normal, natural, reflexive-like responses to stimuli that the client perceives as imminently dangerous.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Fear</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">anxiety</em> describe internal subjective states that involve feelings of distress, accompanied by physiological sensations that are similar to those involved in panic, though typically involving fewer and less severe symptoms. Fear and anxiety can be distinguished from each other because fear is used to describe relatively more acute experiences with an onset that immediately follows the presentation of a stimulus or trigger. Anxiety tends to be used to describe experiences that have a relatively more gradual onset. Fear involves immediate threats, whereas anxiety involves threats that are more distal in time.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">Individuals can often identify the triggering stimulus and describe the sense of threat underlying their fear response. For example, clients with dog phobias know that they are afraid of dogs and report that they are afraid of being attacked and bitten. In contrast, individuals with anxiety sometimes are less able to identify the triggering stimuli and underlying threat. We assess fear and anxiety based on the individual’s reports of their internal states. Complicating the assessment of fear and anxiety, there is considerable variability in the ways that individuals use these terms and in their awareness and expression of the internal states associated with these terms. That variability is likely related to the individual’s prior learning history regarding awareness and expression of their internal states, including beliefs and expectations shared with others in their cultural groups and families.</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">The term <span id="ITerm14"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">avoidance</em></span> is typically used to describe overt, gross motor behaviors that individuals use to prevent contact with the stimuli that trigger fear responses. A common example of an avoidance behavior for an individual with a spider phobia is refusing to go into a basement where spiders have been encountered in the past. The term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">escape</em> includes overt, gross motor behaviors that individuals use to reduce or eliminate contact with the triggering stimulus. A common example of an escape behavior for an individual with claustrophobia is leaving a crowded store to feel less anxious.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14"><span id="ITerm15">Avoidance</span> and escape behaviors can also involve <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">covert avoidance</em> behaviors, including cognitive and attentional processes, such as distracting oneself from thinking about a feared stimulus. Avoidance behaviors can also be distinguished as those that happen prior to encountering the feared stimulus, and those that happen in the presence of the feared stimulus. Those that happen in the presence of the feared stimulus are known as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">safety behaviors</em>. Safety behaviors, also known as in-situation avoidance behaviors, are defined as subtle avoidance behaviors that are intended to prevent a feared catastrophe (Helbig-Lang &amp; Petermann, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). As examples, someone with acrophobia (fear of heights) might avoid looking out of a window in a tall building; someone afraid of escalators might grip the rubber handrail while riding an escalator; someone with social anxiety might avoid eye contact when speaking with a potential dating partner; and some people with panic disorder monitor their heart rate when afraid. These behaviors maintain the presenting problem because they ironically increase the salience and likelihood of feared consequences. Like other avoidance and escape behaviors, they also prevent exposure to the feared stimulus and preclude opportunities for the individual to have experiences that would reduce their perceptions of threat.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading">Description of the Major Anxiety Disorders</h2><div class="Para" id="Par15">The major anxiety disorders involve a controlling stimulus, a fear response, and avoidance and escape behaviors. The application of this framework to specific phobia, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and GAD is presented in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">8.1</a></span>.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_8_Chapter/106097_6_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:53.75em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 8.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Application of the two component framework to four <span id="ITerm16">anxiety disorders</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Specific Phobia</h3><p class="Para" id="Par16"><span id="ITerm17"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Specific phobia</em></span> is defined as “marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood)” (American Psychiatric Association (APA), <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 225). The specific object or situation that evokes the fear responses is the controlling stimulus. The diagnosis includes categorization of the controlling stimuli into one of five subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, situational, or other type. Greater specification of the boundaries of the controlling stimuli (i.e., the stimuli that are necessary and sufficient to trigger the problematic response) is highly desirable and ultimately is necessary for treatment planning using exposure-based treatments. For example, fear responses might be evoked by any dog, by specific types or breeds of dogs, or by dogs in certain settings or under certain circumstances (e.g., unaccompanied dogs off the leash).</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">Diagnosis of a specific phobia requires the phobic object or situation to almost always trigger an immediate fear response that is “out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 225). In addition to fear and <span id="ITerm18">anxiety</span>, the reflex-like response can also include full or limited-symptom panic attacks that are situation-bound. In some cases when the problematic response is triggered by blood-related stimuli (i.e., when the controlling stimulus or antecedent is the sight of blood, hypodermic needles, injuries, etc.), the response might be better characterized as involving syncope or presyncope sensations, such as a drop in blood pressure, feelings of nausea and lightheadedness, and/or fainting. There is some evidence that disgust might be activated as part of some, perhaps all, fear responses found in anxiety disorders (Woody &amp; Teachman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR72" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">Specific phobia typically involves avoidance and escape behaviors that are overt and easily identified. Although identification of safety behavior is not essential for diagnosis, it is usually important for effective treatment <span id="ITerm19">planning</span> using exposure-based therapy. These behaviors are typically identified through direct observation during exposure trials.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Panic Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par19"><span id="ITerm20"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Panic disorder</em></span> is distinct from the diagnosis of panic attacks. Panic attacks (defined above) are relatively discrete experiences. They are common among individuals with anxiety disorders and not uncommon among individuals with other disorders and those who do not meet the criteria for any disorder (Norton et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a></span>). Assessment of panic attacks is necessary to determine the appropriateness of panic disorder.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">In <span id="ITerm21">panic disorder</span>, the first component consists of an interoceptive sensation (e.g., pounding heart, feelings of dizziness, etc. as the controlling stimulus) and a panic attack (as the reflex-like response). Individuals with panic disorder sometimes do not identify the controlling stimulus. The absence of an external controlling stimulus leads the individual to experience their panic attacks as unexpected or “out of the blue” panic attacks. The diagnosis of panic disorder requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Although not essential for DSM diagnosis, preliminary identification of the internal triggering stimulus can be useful for treatment planning. This identification can often be accomplished by asking about the individual’s first panic attack, the first physiological sensation that the individual typically notices during a panic attack, the first sensation that the individual noticed during a recent “bad” panic attack, and/or by listening for the individual’s comments recognizing specific threats. A person might readily acknowledge the threat perception that underlies their fear responses or might dismiss or deny such perceptions in a motivated manner. For example, an individual might report “I noticed my heart was pounding, but it’s not like I thought I was having a heart attack.” In this instance, the individual identifies a racing heart as an early symptom of the panic attack and offers an unsolicited denial that they believed they were having a heart attack. Verbal behaviors, both <span id="ITerm22">acknowledgments</span> and motivated denials, provide clues to identify the controlling stimulus. The ultimate identification of the controlling stimuli takes place during exposure to physiological sensations during the interoceptive exercises of exposure therapy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">The second component in panic disorder includes problematic avoidance behaviors, such as monitoring, checking, and reassurance seeking. Clients with panic disorder often report checking their heart rate, searching on the internet for information about various symptoms and medical conditions, and overusing medical services (e.g., emergency room visits). Panic disorder often <span id="ITerm23">involves</span> a number of more subtle in-situation avoidance behaviors (i.e., safety behaviors), such as carrying anxiolytic medications (e.g., benzodiazepines), engaging in relaxation or breathing techniques to reduce sudden anxiety, adopting idiosyncratic postures, or being accompanied by a trusted “safe” person.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Agoraphobia</h3><p class="Para" id="Par22"><span id="ITerm24"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Agoraphobia</em></span> is characterized as the distinct fear of public situations using public transportation; being in enclosed, crowded, or open spaces; or being outside of the home alone (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Clients might report a fear of having a panic attack, becoming anxious, having to go to the bathroom, or not being able to escape or receive help in the situation (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The DSM-5-TR conceptualizes agoraphobia as separate and relatively independent from panic disorder. In prior versions of the DSM, agoraphobia and panic disorder were more closely linked. When agoraphobia is present with panic disorder, agoraphobia can usually be thought of as the avoidance (behavior) that is associated with panic attacks. When agoraphobia is present but there are no reports of recent panic attacks, it is important to question the individual about the period during which agoraphobia began; a history (sometimes quite remote) of panic disorder is common. For those occasional cases in which agoraphobia is present and there is no history of panic, a simpler <span id="ITerm25">one-component</span> (operant association) model appears appropriate. That simpler model would recognize antecedents (e.g., open spaces such as shopping malls, bridges, highways) and agoraphobic avoidance, the function of which is to avoid harm.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Social Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par23">For <span id="ITerm26"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">social anxiety disorder</em></span>, fear responses include fear, anxiety, and full and limited symptom panic attacks, specifically related to the fear of negative evaluations from others during social interactions (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). It is also not unusual for individuals with social anxiety disorder to describe less acute anxiety experiences, such as those that have a more gradual onset in anticipation of events that are more distal in time (e.g., having to give a presentation 1 week later). For many individuals, the experience is more readily characterized as discomfort, worry, and/or anxiety than as fear. The stimulus controlling the fear response involves a social element, and the individual typically expresses concern about being evaluated or scrutinized.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">It is important to consider the boundaries of the controlling stimuli. The types of social stimuli that evoke fear responses can vary. For many individuals, most or all social situations evoke a fear response. For some individuals, the fear is evoked by specific classes of situations, such as interacting with a potential dating <span id="ITerm27">partner</span>, talking with an authority figure, using a public restroom, speaking to a large group, meeting new individuals, etc. For example, an individual might report feeling anxiety when meeting new people but experiencing little or no anxiety when meeting with family members or friends.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">Social anxiety that is experienced in many social situations is often thought of as shyness (Brook &amp; Willoughby, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Many, but not all, individuals with social anxiety disorder are shy. Some are outgoing and experience fear responses and inhibited behavior only in a limited number of social situations. When the controlling stimulus is highly specific (e.g., using a public restroom when other people are present), it is not unusual for the individual to report relatively low anxiety in other social <span id="ITerm28">situations</span> (e.g., meeting new people, giving presentations to groups). When the stimulus that evokes the fear response (i.e., the controlling stimulus) is limited to social performance situations, the performance-only specifier is used (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Understanding which stimuli evoke anxiety and which do not is also important for treatment planning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">It is not unusual for clinical interviews to evoke fear responses in individuals, particularly in those with significant social anxiety. The fear responses can lead to avoidance and escape behaviors, resulting in distorted representations of symptoms and inhibited behavior during the assessment interview. Many individuals with social anxiety can be anxious about other people knowing that they have social anxiety. This phenomenon may be particularly relevant for socially anxious individuals seeking services for a different presenting problem (e.g., another anxiety disorder, low social <span id="ITerm29">support,</span> depression, etc.), expressing less or no concern about social anxiety. Some individuals with social anxiety have avoided thinking of their problem as one of social anxiety because doing so implies, to some degree, a prescription for greater social approach and less social avoidance behaviors. For this reason, social anxiety disorder is likely to be underdiagnosed when it is not identified by the individual seeking services as the presenting problem.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">Safety behaviors associated with <span id="ITerm30">social anxiety disorder</span> can be quite idiosyncratic but can be broadly categorized as those that involve withdrawal and those that involve overcompensation. These categories can be called “laying low” and “putting on” (Gier, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Laying low might involve standing motionless during a speech, not speaking during a social encounter, standing apart from others or in the back of a group, avoiding eye contact, constraining the tone of one’s voice, and other behaviors to reduce the degree to which one is noticed. Putting on might involve speaking at a fast pace, smiling inappropriately, pacing or nervously fidgeting while giving a presentation to a group, etc. Sometimes behaving like a clown or rigidly adopting a comical approach can be safety behaviors.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">One feature of social anxiety disorder is post-event processing. In post-event processing, individuals with social anxiety often repeatedly recall and rehearse or replay the social interaction, emphasizing negative <span id="ITerm31">aspects</span> of the encounter. Clinicians should be aware that an individual with social anxiety may engage in post-event processing of the therapy session or assessment which may then increase the risk that they drop out of treatment.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par29"><span id="ITerm32">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</span> might be misdiagnosed because the name of the disorder contributes to a neglect of the cardinal feature of the disorder: worry. The defining feature of GAD<span id="ITerm33"/> is anxiety and worry, worry that is characterized by symptoms of physiological arousal, is experienced as uncontrollable, and occurs more days or not over a period of 6 months or more. People with generalized anxiety disorder invariably agree that they worry too much, that they overthink things, that they spend a lot of time in their heads, that they are a “worrier” or a “worry wart,” and/or that they have always been a worrier. It is not uncommon for GAD to be misdiagnosed in individuals who have experiences of anxiety in which worry is not prominent, but whose experiences do not readily fit with other anxiety disorder categories. If worry is not prominent, the interviewer should consider diagnoses of anxiety disorder, NOS; an adjustment disorder with anxiety or mixed anxiety and depression; or mood disorders.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">Contemporary models of worry view worry as avoidance behavior (Sibrava &amp; Borkovec, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Information about the first component is usually not apparent, including the controlling stimulus and the reflex-like response that presumably serves as the antecedent in the second component. That is, worry appears to serve an avoidance function, but it is often not clear what the client is avoiding. Many clients report that their worry episodes are preceded by “down time,” periods when there are fewer demands on them, and/or periods when they felt bored. Consistent with that <span id="ITerm34">observation</span>, some theorists have suggested that worry prevents sudden changes in negative affect levels by maintaining a relatively consistent, moderately high level of anxiety, avoiding dramatic shifts in anxiety (Newman &amp; Llera, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). Others have proposed that worry distracts the individual from feelings of uncertainty (Koerner &amp; Dugas, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). We have observed that clients presenting for treatment of severe worry symptoms are often experiencing significant transitions, perhaps triggering existential concerns. The diagnostic criteria for GAD do not make reference to the controlling stimuli (cues and triggers) of worry.</p></section>

This approach is sometimes called an A-B-C assessment approach because it involves assessing the antecedents (A), behaviors (B), and consequences (C). For anxiety disorders, much of the information needed to complete a functional assessment is evident early in the assessment process. The presenting problem typically identifies the fear responses that serve as the reflex-like behavior associated with the respondent component of the disorders; fear, anxiety, or full or limited symptom panic attacks are often the most prominent feature of anxiety disorders. Here are some general questions to elicit information about the fear responses:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><p class="Para" id="Par32">What happens when you have one of these reactions? What are your feelings, sensations, thoughts, and behaviors? What did you experience? How did you feel?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par33">Which physical sensations, if any, did you notice? How about a racing heart? Muscle tension? Nausea? Lightheadedness? etc.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par34">Did you become more alert or hypervigilant? Did you have difficulty concentrating?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="Para" id="Par35">The presenting problem also <span id="ITerm36">typically</span> includes avoidance and escape behaviors that are often inadequate to manage the fear responses and sometimes cause separate problems. Individuals with anxiety disorders often readily acknowledge their gross motor avoidance and escape behaviors. Here are some general questions to elicit information about avoidance and escape behaviors:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><p class="Para" id="Par36">What have you tried to do in these situations?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par37">How do you cope in these situations? How do you avoid or manage the situations that evoke those reactions?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par38">How has this fear/anxiety/panic affected your life? How has your life changed since these panic attacks began?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par39">How would your life be different if you no longer had these panic attacks?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="Para" id="Par40">Here are some general questions that are sometimes useful for identifying controlling stimuli:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><p class="Para" id="Par41">When and in what <span id="ITerm37">situations</span> do you feel anxious or afraid? In what situations do you panic? What thoughts did you have?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par42">When did you last have a fear reaction? What were you doing right before the fear reaction started?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par43">During a recent bad fear reaction, what was the first thing you noticed? What was the second thing you noticed?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par043">If you wanted to bring about a fear reaction, what could you do? What situatin could you put yourself in?</p></li></ul></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par44">For specific phobias, investigation of the fear-evoking stimuli might be needed to specify the subtype. For social anxiety disorder, additional investigation of the fear-evoking stimuli is needed to determine if the performance specifier is needed. For panic disorder, at least some of the panic attacks must be experienced as “unexpected,” without any apparent external stimulus acting as a trigger. As described above in the description of GAD, identification of antecedents of worry is usually not possible.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec12"><h3 class="Heading">Thought Experiments as Experimental Functional Analysis</h3><p class="Para" id="Par45"><span id="ITerm38">Functional assessment</span> sometimes involves experimental procedures to discover antecedents (i.e., experimental functional analysis). For example, consider an individual with an intellectual disability who appears to have phobic reactions but is unable or unwilling to report on the objects or situations that evoke those fear responses. An experimental functional analysis might involve exposing that individual to different objects or situations and observing fear responses and avoidance behaviors. We might suspect that the individual has a dog phobia, leading us to observe the individual in the presence of various dogs, in various situations. We might then also observe the individual in the presence of other animals, such as cats or hamsters. By identifying the objects and situations to which the individual has fear responses, and those to which the individual does not, we can analyze the boundaries of the stimuli that control fear responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Many of the individuals that we assess for anxiety disorders are able to report on the objects or situations that evoke fear responses. We can also ask individuals to imagine different situations. Consider, for example, an individual who reports experiencing panic attacks, but some, perhaps all, of these attacks take place in the presence of other people. There is a need for a differential diagnosis between panic disorder and social anxiety disorder with panic attacks. First, we can ask the client to imagine not experiencing a panic attack while in the presence of other people who notice that the client is anxious, nervous, or uncomfortable. Then, we can ask the client to imagine being alone while the client is experiencing a panic attack. If the person reports a high level of aversion to the first situation but finds the second situation manageable, social anxiety disorder is implicated. If the person reports a high level of aversion to the second situation, but reports that the first situation is manageable, panic disorder is implicated. If the person shows a high level of aversion to both situations, both diagnoses are implicated (i.e., comorbid for social anxiety disorder and panic disorder). Most individuals can accurately report how they would react in various imagined situations, allowing the clinician to efficiently probe to understand the boundaries of the controlling stimuli.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading">Consideration of Context and the Interviewee’s Attitude Toward the Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par47">Individuals vary in their reporting of their symptoms, with some minimizing and others amplifying their anxiety and avoidance. This variation depends in part upon the context of the assessment and in part upon the individual’s prior experiences with regard to reporting behavior. In primary care settings, anxiety disorders often go undetected (Vermani et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) and so are often left untreated (Kroenke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). People seeking help for anxiety problems are typically eager for the clinician to understand and appreciate the extent of their suffering and distress, and thus may readily describe the most problematic aspects of their experience and behavior. Alternatively, it is not unusual for individuals to feel embarrassed or ashamed about their overt and covert gross motor behaviors. Ambivalence about seeking help is common, and individuals can have limited awareness of some of their symptoms (i.e., safety behaviors, threat perceptions, etc.).</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">The assessment of the symptoms of anxiety disorders is complicated by the fact that the assessment process relies upon questions that can serve as controlling stimuli; questions about fear cues and triggers can evoke fear responses. For example, asking an individual if they are particularly afraid of snakes evokes mental images of snakes. Those images might lead the individual to request that the clinician stop using the “s-word” (i.e., not use the word “snake”). This observation is often relevant when working with individuals who experience severe social anxiety because the questions used in the assessment create demands on the individual. This analysis suggests that clinicians should do what they can to create a non-threatening environment, especially for individuals with social anxiety. There is some evidence that building rapport with individuals with social anxiety requires a more business-like and matter-of-fact approach, rather than an overly warm and friendly approach (Valentiner &amp; Skowronski, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). Clinicians should be vigilant for fear responses during the assessment process and should use their observations about the triggers of those fear responses to inform diagnostic decisions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">Also note that verbal behavior, like other behaviors, can serve an avoidance function; anxious clients sometimes deny or minimize symptoms of distress and avoidance. For example, anxious individuals sometimes say things like “It wasn’t like I thought I was going to have a heart attack” or “I know it’s not going to hurt me.” These individuals may, in effect, be embarrassed to acknowledge the irrationality of the perceptions underlying their fear responses and avoidance behaviors. Unsolicited denials appear to be the product of motivated cognition and can belie the presence of implicit irrational beliefs that underlie fear responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">Anxious individuals can also amplify their feelings of distress and minimize their autonomy. For example, anxious individuals sometimes say things like “I couldn’t stay in the room—I had to leave” or “I couldn’t look at it—I had to turn my head.” Such variability in anxious individuals’ awareness of and reporting of their symptoms can be viewed as reflecting ambivalence. Such comments also conflate ability and willingness. With sufficient inducements (e.g., being offered a huge sum of money to stay, being threatened with the death of a loved one, etc.) they might decide to “look at it.” In response, a clinician might respond by acknowledging the difficulty but not reinforcing the lack of agency (e.g., “It felt like you had no choice.”). This variability in presentation appears to have the functions of soliciting aid and reducing demands to confront feared stimuli or to experience fear responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Children and adolescents are more likely to be referred by another person (i.e., by a parent or teacher) and therefore more likely to engage in denial and minimization of symptoms, cognitive avoidance, and resistance to the assessment process. It is useful to note the nature of the referral (e.g., self-versus other-referred), make observations about the individual’s reporting behavior (e.g., over-versus under-reporting), and consider what the individual has learned about being aware of and verbally describing their anxious thoughts and feelings.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">The increase in the prevalence of mental health concerns, including anxiety, over the past 20 years (Goodwin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>) is not well understood (Foulkes &amp; Andrews, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). This increase is likely related to the social processes, the consequences of reporting, and the cultural meaning of symptoms (Haslam, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). Interviewers should appreciate the intersubjectivity of the social process that we call the clinical interview and consider whether they are inadvertently reinforcing behaviors that maintain fear responses and avoidance.</p></section>

Additionally, the semi-structured nature of the interviews allows the interviewers to ask more in-depth questions about potentially relevant disorders and omit questions about irrelevant disorders. Familiarity with one or more of these protocols (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">8.1</a></span>) greatly increases the reliability and validity of the initial diagnoses.<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 8.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Semi-structured interview <span id="ITerm39">protocols</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ;

Anxiety disorders included in the SCID-5 include panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and GAD. The SCID-5 also screens for specific phobia and separation anxiety disorder, but further interviewing would be required to make a diagnosis of these disorders. The SCID-5 is an adaptive interview and can take between 30 min and 2 h depending on the number of symptoms the interviewee endorses. The SCID-5 has been found to have good clinical validity and satisfactory interrater reliability for anxiety disorders (Osório et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">The Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and OCD and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DIAMOND</em>)<span id="ITerm40"/> is a semi-structured clinical interview that assesses for anxiety, mood, somatic, obsessive-compulsive, trauma-related, feeding and eating, substance-related, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The anxiety disorder portion of the DIAMOND assesses for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, GAD, specific phobia, and separation anxiety disorder.

The ADIS-5 is designed to evaluate an individual for anxiety disorder but includes other disorders that may have similar presentations to assess for differential diagnosis. The ADIS-5 also includes a dimensional assessment of features and questions to prompt a functional analysis of most disorders. The ADIS-5 takes approximately 2 to 4 h to administer.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec18"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustration</h2><p class="Para" id="Par62">Louise was a 29-year-old Caucasian woman seeking an assessment for symptoms of distress around social interactions, feelings of isolation, low mood, and difficulties focusing while attending academic classes. At the time of the assessment, Louise was living with her long-term partner, attending university full-time, and working part-time. She stated that she had a hard time interacting with people besides her partner and would become extremely upset if she believed someone was upset with her or that she was being rejected by someone. She sometimes cried in public when someone was upset with her and after conflict with or feeling distant from her partner and had a difficult time making new friends. Louise also reported frequently feeling overwhelmed by tasks she needed to complete, leading her to procrastinate and to be late or not complete them. Louise originally expressed the belief that she would meet the diagnostic criteria for <span id="ITerm56">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</span> due to her distress around social interactions and information she had read about ASD online.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">Due to the range of symptoms reported during the initial unstructured general intake interview, the assessment proceeded to the DIAMOND. This interview protocol helps the clinician to differentiate between similar presenting disorders. Louise filled out the DIAMOND screener which allowed the clinician to focus on the potentially relevant diagnosis. She endorsed the prompts related to social anxiety disorder, GAD, and MDD. One of Louise’s main areas of concern was her issues with social interactions. She expressed worrying frequently about what others thought of her, feeling like she could not connect with others, and having difficulty maintaining eye contact (which was also observed by the clinician). According to her responses to the DIAMOND, Louise was able to maintain some social relationships and a positive romantic relationship. However, she stated that she finds it hard to maintain some of these relationships because she constantly worries that she has upset or is disliked by the other person. This fear often leads her to avoid social interactions that she would otherwise like to engage in. Her responses on the DIAMOND indicated that she met the criteria for social anxiety disorder.</p><p class="Para" id="Par64">Although Louise expressed feeling anxiety outside of a direct social context, she did not meet the criteria for GAD because her anxiety and worry all involved being socially evaluated by others. For example, she experienced high levels of anxiety which prevented her from working on her art but stated that this anxiety was due to thoughts that others would not like her work. Louise expressed having trouble completing other minor tasks like chores because she felt overwhelmed by them. In responding to the interview questions on the DIAMOND, it became clear these feelings were better related to low motivation rather than feelings of anxiety. This symptom, along with general feelings of low mood, negative thoughts, and loss of interest in other activities were consistent with criteria for MDD.</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">The last potential diagnosis that needed to be assessed for was ASD. Since none of the structured interviews assess for both anxiety disorders and ASD, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>) was administered to see if Louise would meet the criteria for an ASD diagnosis. Although Louise did express discomfort around social interaction and eye contact, she did not exhibit unusually restricted interests, inflexibility to change, stereotyped movements, or deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. This absence of ASD symptoms indicated that Louise’s reported difficulty with social interactions and maintaining relationships is likely better explained by the MDD and social anxiety disorder diagnoses. Scores on the self-report measures of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale—Short Form (SIAS-SF) further documented elevated levels of depression and social anxiety symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par66">Louise’s initial belief that she would meet the criteria for ASD presented a potential challenge for the feedback session. The results and observations from the ADOS-2 were particularly helpful in reframing Louise’s experience. Rather than showing deficits in social and emotional reciprocity due to a lack of perception of social cues, Louise readily agreed that she was painfully aware of and overly sensitive to social cues. Social anxiety disorder was framed as due to overvaluing others’ opinions, which she readily accepted as describing herself.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec19"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par67">When assessing a client for an anxiety disorder, there are many individual factors (e.g., gender, culture, age) that may impact the presentation and assessment of the disorder. Awareness and consideration of these factors may help increase the validity of a suggested diagnosis, especially for individuals whose identities may have been historically underrepresented in clinical research.</p><p class="Para" id="Par68">The degree to which the interviewer and client differ in cultural (and subcultural) background, and in their positionality in society, the interviewer should hold their conceptualization of the client’s problems lightly. This conceptualization includes the two-component behavioral framework described here. Our understandings of the world (including our social world) attempt to reduce complexity to more manageable within the limits of human cognition; the DSM and behavioral two-component frameworks are reductionistic. Awareness of the potential usefulness of these frameworks should be balanced with an awareness of their limitations as cultural constructs.</p><p class="Para" id="Par69">Even after the assessment is complete, the imperfect reliability of our diagnostic procedures warrants viewing the diagnosis as provisional, subject to confirmation or correction using information from the client during therapy. The diagnosis of anxiety disorders, and the behavioral conceptualization that is implied by the diagnostic label, can be viewed as a frame that is possibly useful to the client. The diagnosis should not be reified. It is descriptive, and like any description, it is incomplete. Clinicians are typically in positions of power over clients, positions that include expertise if not authority. The positionality that comes with the roles of clinician and client creates the potential for the clinician’s pronouncements to negate the client’s experience. Therapy can be viewed as the process by which the client can learn about a new conceptualization of their problem, but the client is the ultimate arbitrator as to whether that new conceptualization is useful to them. During therapy, the clinician can invite the client to engage in new behaviors to find out if the new conceptualization fits with their experiences. Clinicians need not abandon their beliefs in order to adopt a collaborative approach—they should have humility about the complexity of the human experience and about their own beliefs.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec20"><h3 class="Heading">Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation</h3><p class="Para" id="Par70">Research has found that women are almost twice as likely as men to receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder over their lifetime (McLean et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). However, there does not appear to be any gender differences in the age of onset and chronology of anxiety disorders (McLean et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). The gender difference in the prevalence of anxiety disorders is often described via the vulnerability-stress model. This biological predisposition (Lebron-Milad &amp; Milad, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>) is then paired with experiences of gender-role socialization, increased reported life stress for women, and the use of emotion-focus coping to further explain the sex differences in anxiety disorders (Matud, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR003" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). Additionally, there is the risk of gender bias in client reporting of symptoms in which men may be less willing to disclose feelings of anxiety due to gendered socialization which taught them that these feelings were not acceptable for men (Hallers-Haalboom et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par71"><span id="ITerm57">Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender (LGBT)</span> individuals have also been found to report higher rates of anxiety than their straight or cisgender peers (Reisner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The minority stress model theorizes that this increased risk is due to additional environmental stress resulting from factors like discrimination, stigma, and structural inequity due to heteronormativity leading to higher rates of anxiety (Meyer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>). Transgender youth have also been found to report significantly higher rates of GAD compared to their cisgender peers (Chodzen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR001" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). This relationship is believed to be particularly strong for transgender youth who reported thoughts of internalized transphobia. Clinicians should be cognizant of the increased risk of anxiety disorders for women and LGBT individuals and the potential predisposition for underreporting of symptoms in men when considering a diagnosis.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec21"><h3 class="Heading">Older Adults</h3><p class="Para" id="Par72">Anxiety disorders are generally found to be less common for older adults compared to younger adults (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR70" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). However, despite this overall decrease in prevalence as a function of age, anxiety disorders are still one of the most diagnosed disorders in older individuals. Assessment for anxiety disorders is often more difficult than for younger adults due to differences in how older adults describe anxiety, higher rates of medical comorbidities that complicate or mask diagnosis, and cognitive changes due to age-related decline (Balsamo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Older adults are less likely to discuss their negative emotions or select absolute descriptors like “never” and “always” when completing self-report measures (Balsamo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Additionally, compared to younger adults, older adults are more likely to report feelings of shame and guilt related to anxiety disorder rather than feelings of fear. Due to these known differences in the presentation of anxiety disorder in older adults, specific self-report measures have been developed to assess anxiety in this population. The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (Pachana et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>), Geriatric Anxiety Scale (Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>), and Worry Scale (Wisocki et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR69" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a></span>) are well-supported self-report measures for assessing anxiety symptoms in older adults.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec22"><h3 class="Heading">Children and Adolescents</h3><p class="Para" id="Par73">A recent national survey found that 7.8% of children ages 3 to 17 in the United States reported symptoms of a current anxiety <span id="ITerm58">disorder</span> (US Department of Commerce, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Some diagnoses are found almost exclusively in children including selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder. When assessing symptoms of anxiety disorders in children, it is important to be aware of behaviors like tantrums, irritability, and crying which may be misattributed to disobedience rather <span id="ITerm59">than</span> an anxiety disorder. Distress and avoidance manifest in varied forms, and that variation is greater among populations with less developed verbal abilities and skills. Children are also more likely to report physiological symptoms of anxiety like headaches and gastrointestinal distress (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Additionally, children may have a hard time identifying their avoidant behaviors, so reports from parents and teachers may be particularly important. Developmentally appropriate fears and worries should not be considered as evidence of an anxiety disorder. Measures specifically designed for assessing anxiety disorders in children include the Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAMS-5; Martinez-Snyder et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>; Muris et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) and the Patient Health Questionnaire—Adolescent (Johnson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec23"><h3 class="Heading">Race and Culture</h3><p class="Para" id="Par74">Previous research has found that White Americans were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders compared to Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans (Asnaani et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). This finding was found even when controlling for the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of the participants. In the same study, Asian Americans were the least likely to report an anxiety disorder. Additionally, individuals who immigrated to the United States were found to have lower rates of GAD than those born in the United States (Budhwani et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). However, the study also found that experiences of racial or ethnic discrimination were significantly associated with an increased risk of GAD. The increased stress experienced by racial or ethnic minority individuals in the United States from experiences of discrimination and transgenerational passing of stress is hypothesized to increase the risk that an individual will develop an anxiety disorder (Thoits, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Additionally, the differences between diagnosis rates of anxiety disorders may be due to lower utilization of mental healthcare services by Black and Hispanic individuals compared to White individuals in the United States (De Luca et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par75">Some descriptions of anxiety are culturally bound. In the Culture and Psychiatric Diagnosis section of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em>, there are examples of some of these culturally based concepts for describing or understanding distress which clients may reference (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). For instance, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nervios</em> is a term used in many Latinx communities to describe a range of symptoms including headaches, nervousness, gastrointestinal disturbance, emotional distress, and inability to complete tasks (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Additionally, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> identifies some culture-bound disorders that share some similarities to the disorders described in the anxiety section of the book. A diagnosis of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">taijin kyofusho</em> may be more descriptive than social anxiety disorder for an individual from Japan who expresses anxiety around social interactions due to a fear that their appearance or odor will offend others.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec24"><h3 class="Heading">Socioeconomic Status</h3><p class="Para" id="Par76">Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be associated with high rates of anxiety disorders and poorer treatment outcomes (Nunes et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Additionally, low neighborhood income and high crime rates were also associated with elevated levels of general anxiety (Finegan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Longitudinal research suggests that both growing up in poverty and experiencing life events that <span id="ITerm60">result</span> in increased financial hardship are predictors for developing a variety of negative mental health outcomes including increased anxiety (Ridley et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities often function to sustain anxiety disorder through financial barriers to treatments, increased worry about finances, and potentially higher rates of exposure to crime near the home (Ridley et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec25"><h3 class="Heading">Intersections of Identities</h3><p class="Para" id="Par77">Many clients hold one or more of the identities referenced in this section. It is important for clinicians to be aware of how intersecting identities may impact the frequency and presentation of anxiety disorders. For example, the previously identified sex differences in diagnosed anxiety disorders have been shown to decrease for individuals over the age of 65 notably. This change in prevalence is hypothesized to be due to a number of factors including the impact of mortality-related <span id="ITerm61">anxiety</span>, difficulty differentiating anxiety from age-based cognitive decline, and hormonal changes associated with the end of the female reproductive cycle (Krasucki et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>). During the assessment process, the clinician should consider the client’s identity as a whole within their current context to develop a more comprehensive case conceptualization and diagnosis.</p></section>
</section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec26"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par78">At a minimum, the clinical and diagnostic interview needs to collect information about the nature of the fear response, the boundaries of the controlling stimuli, and escape and avoidance behavior. Evidence from multiple methods is desirable. Regarding the fear response, the presence versus absence of panic attacks, both limited and full, should be determined, as well as the acuity and chronicity of the fear and/or anxiety. Regarding controlling stimuli, boundaries of the controlling stimuli should be determined by self-report and other methods (direct observation, informant report, <span id="ITerm62">information</span> from referring source, self-monitoring, etc.) when possible. Regarding escape and avoidance behavior, reducing threat and/or anxiety should be the implicit motivation (or function) of the behavior. Clinically significant distress or dysfunction should be documented. As with all diagnostic interviews, differential diagnoses must be considered. The anxiety and avoidance must not be due only to the effects of medications or substances, or to medical illness, and should not be better explained by another mental disorder.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec28"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par80">This chapter offers guidelines for conducting diagnostic interviews for anxiety disorders, using an approach that is consistent with the behavioral approach of functional assessment. Clinicians are implored to rely upon a general model that encompasses anxiety disorders, one that recognizes a stimulus-response component and an operant behavior component in which avoidance behavior is viewed as being negatively reinforced by the removal of threat and/or anxiety. This general model offers a single framework that organizes the diagnostic criteria and symptoms of all of the anxiety disorders. Additionally, this chapter describes many of the nuances in how different anxiety disorders present, the implications of anxiety pathology for conducting diagnostic interviews, and other considerations related to the variability in presentation.</p></section>
