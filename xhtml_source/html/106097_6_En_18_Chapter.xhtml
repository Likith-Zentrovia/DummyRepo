There are several factors particular to youth and families that may impact the process of diagnostic interviewing. Like diagnostic interviewing with other populations, it is of utmost importance to approach the process with children with genuine warmth, sensitivity, and cultural humility to build and maintain rapport throughout the interview process. This chapter presents information relevant to the diagnostic interviewing process with children (and their caregivers), including developmental considerations, guidelines for gathering information, a case study to illustrate the process, and strategies for engaging diverse youth populations.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading">Differences Between Adults and Children</h2><p class="Para" id="Par3"><span id="ITerm5">Children</span> are in the midst of intense cognitive and emotional development, which has implications for what might be considered a mental health concern at any given time point. Development can vary widely between children and across contexts. Thus, awareness of developmental processes and contextual expectations is of great importance when conducting diagnostic interviews with children.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Additionally, symptoms of mental health disorders may be different in children compared to adults. While many symptom criteria in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) are often the same in children and adults, interviewers must be aware of slight differences within categories when considering a diagnosis. For example, many diagnoses have shorter duration criteria for children than adults (e.g., a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder in children requires the presence of <span id="ITerm6">symptoms</span> for 1 year, compared to 2 years in adults). Similarly, symptom presentation may also be different in children than adults. As noted in the DSM-5-TR, depressive disorders in children may be characterized more by irritability than sadness. Therefore, a firm grasp on DSM-5-TR criteria relevant to children is important for accurate diagnosis.</p><div class="Para" id="Par5">In addition to differences in diagnostic criteria and symptom presentation, most children present with important contextual factors that are different from those of adults. First, many children do not come in for a diagnostic interview or evaluation of their own volition. As such, many children may not understand why they are presenting for the interview nor recognize their problematic symptoms. Because of this, clinicians should always attempt to assess what the child knows about the diagnostic process, why they think they have been brought to the assessment setting, and the clinician should share developmentally appropriate information and expectations regarding the assessment process. <span id="ITerm7">For</span> example, children may be led to believe that they are going to see a doctor and may be nervous about receiving injections or receiving a physical exam. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of such common misconceptions and explain to the child what will and will not be occurring during the interview. This explanation can be aided by a review of an assent form or pre-interview handout for the child containing developmentally tailored information about the assessment process, in addition to the setting’s standard consent process for the caregiver. For an example of the type of information that may be provided to children, see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">18.1</a></span>. Explaining the interview process to the child and giving them the opportunity to provide their assent gives them a sense of autonomy, trust, and control, even for younger children where assent may not be explicitly required by law.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_18_Chapter/106097_6_En_18_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.48em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 18.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Pre-interview informational handout for children. Note: This example of a pre-interview informational handout might be provided to younger children to read independently or review with their caregivers or clinician during the intake appointment</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par6">Finally, there are <span id="ITerm8">important</span> developmental considerations regarding the procedures for interviewing a child, including adjusting for children’s shorter attention spans, their typical fatigue and boredom during extended discussion, and resultant activity levels. When working with children, it is important to plan frequent breaks and to utilize methods to maintain the child’s attention, focus, and motivation. This may include creating a visual schedule that lists what will be covered during the interview or the schedule of the visit. To increase motivation, clinicians can employ the use of stickers or other reinforcers. These reinforcers can be rewards unto themselves or used to earn rewards at the end of the interview, such as a small prize from a prize box or other incentive. Such strategies are especially helpful for children demonstrating inattention, irritability, or oppositional behavior.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">To address <span id="ITerm9">oppositional </span>behavior, interviewers may need to utilize a higher rate of reinforcement or complete the interview over multiple visits that are shorter in duration. In cases where children are especially challenging or resistant to answering questions, it is of utmost importance for clinicians to establish strong rapport and maintain this rapport throughout. Such children may benefit from less structure or play time with the clinician to build initial rapport. Children should also be told explicitly that they may ask to use the restroom or take a break as necessary. For children who are more active, allow them to stand and walk around the room while the clinician asks questions or toss a soft ball back and forth with the child, if this aids them in better paying attention to the interview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">For especially young <span id="ITerm10">children</span>, or children who present with symptoms of separation anxiety, they may have trouble separating from their caregivers for an interview. This can be a challenging situation, but a clinician may utilize reinforcers to increase compliance and encourage the child to separate briefly. If a child cannot separate from the caregiver without significant distress, it may be better to allow the caregiver to remain in the room and use strategies to maintain the child’s focus on <span id="ITerm11">the</span> clinician (e.g., have caregiver wear headphones, etc.).</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Using the Referral Question</h3><p class="Para" id="Par9">Prior to an initial <span id="ITerm12">evaluation</span> or diagnostic interview with a child, a brief screen is often conducted to determine appropriateness of the referral for a given clinic or practice. This might include basic demographic information, referral source, and reason for referral. For children, this information is typically provided by a caregiver who is seeking an evaluation for treatment or further assessment (i.e., psychoeducational or neuropsychological assessment). The referral question is critical to identifying appropriate assessment tools and formulating an initial set of hypotheses for the diagnostic evaluation process. The referral question is also important for determining whether the services requested can be provided in that setting.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Whom to Meet With</h3><p class="Para" id="Par10">The referral <span id="ITerm13">question</span> can provide valuable information about who to meet with to conduct the diagnostic interview and obtain relevant information. Depending on the purpose of the interview and the feasibility of communicating with other sources of information, the interviewer may wish to gather relevant data from others who observe the child in different contexts (i.e., collateral informants). This may include teachers, other caregivers or family members, siblings, or other service providers. In addition to interviewing the caregiver, child, and collateral informants, the order in which these individuals are interviewed can be important and can influence the process of diagnosing. Clinicians should be mindful that informants are likely to be discrepant in their reporting about the child. Children behave differently in different environments and informants may also view problems differently, resulting in reporting discrepancies. Clinicians must integrate information provided by all informants to understand <span id="ITerm14">the </span>presenting concerns and should therefore consider the vantage points of the informant in the child’s life (e.g., the child’s teacher versus caregiver) and how the environment may impact the child’s behavior with that informant.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Although the child themself is a critical source of information for the interview process, caregivers are often the people responsible for bringing children to the clinic and scheduling services, so it is important that they be interviewed to obtain relevant information about the child. Often, the caregiver is the most reliable source of information about the child’s developmental history, the history of their presenting concerns, and information about the targets of intervention. As children get older and develop more awareness and insight, however, they may become a more reliable source of information, particularly information about their internal experience of symptoms. At times, children may be referred for evaluation or treatment by other providers or adults who are not the <span id="ITerm15">primary</span> caregivers (e.g., teachers, healthcare professionals, judicial or child protective system), and the caregiver may have less information about the presenting concerns because they have not observed these issues, or they do not perceive these issues as a problem. For example, children demonstrating behavioral concerns in the school setting may be referred for services by school personnel, and the caregiver may not observe the same problematic behavior in the home. In cases like these, speaking with the initial referral source can be important, but meaningful information can still be obtained from the caregiver by asking questions specific to the reason for referral. Furthermore, caregivers expressing that they do not perceive their child to have a problem despite concerns raised by others is informative. This may suggest, for example, that the child’s behavior is quite different across environments, that the caregiver or overarching culture of the child views the symptoms as stigmatizing, or that <span id="ITerm16">caregivers</span> <span id="ITerm17">perceive</span> the problems as being manageable without mental health intervention.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">Interviewing <span id="ITerm18">caregivers</span> can also provide useful information about the targets for treatment and the child’s environment. In addition to gathering information from caregivers about the child, meeting with the caregivers allows the clinician to obtain information about the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">caregivers and family</em> that is pertinent to diagnosis and treatment. The way caregivers react to problematic behavior or clinical concerns, their perception of the causes of the problem, parenting stress, caregiver psychopathology, caregiver perceptions of family and social culture in which child resides, and their resources or motivation to address the problem are all important for diagnosis, case conceptualization, and treatment. If <span id="ITerm19">children</span> spend a great deal of time with other caregivers (e.g., a nanny, grandparent), obtaining consent from the <span id="ITerm20">caregiver</span> to speak with these individuals may also be helpful.</p><div class="Para" id="Par13">Teachers or other service providers can often provide helpful information about the child’s behavior in different settings. It is important to obtain consent from the guardian to communicate with these individuals. When interviewing teachers, it can be helpful to interview more than one teacher. Speaking with the <span id="ITerm21">caregiver</span> about which teachers would be most willing to communicate and able to provide information about the child’s school behavior may be necessary. Asking to speak to a teacher in a class where the child is doing well and one where the child is having more challenges is a useful way to understand the child’s strengths and difficulties, as well as the ways in which the environment impacts their behavior. Other service providers, such as psychiatrists and former <span id="ITerm22">clinicians, </span>may also be helpful for getting information about the child. Many times, children are referred for services by other providers, and obtaining information about the reason they referred the child for services can be useful. A summary of the sources of information and types of information that may be provided by each source is included in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">18.1</a></span>.<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 18.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Sources of <span id="ITerm23">information</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Source</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Type of information</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Child</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• Direct information about their own experience of symptoms or presenting concerns</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Caregivers</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• Developmental history</p><p class="SimplePara">• Treatment history</p><p class="SimplePara">• History of presenting problems and current concerns</p><p class="SimplePara">• Family dynamic and parenting strategies</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Referral source</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• Information about the reason for referral, particularly helpful if caregiver does not perceive a problem</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Teachers</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• Observations of the child in a different setting, outside the home</p><p class="SimplePara">• Information about child’s school functioning</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Other service providers</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• Treatment history</p><p class="SimplePara">• Prior effective and ineffective strategies</p><p class="SimplePara">• Medical/psychiatric history</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Direct observations</p></td><td style="text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">• School observation: Child’s behavior in the school context</p><p class="SimplePara">• Home/family observation: Family dynamic and home environment</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par14">While interviewing multiple informants across settings may be useful for obtaining comprehensive and thorough information about a child, this requires additional effort and time on the part of the clinician. Such extensive interviewing may be customary in some settings for different types of services (e.g., psychoeducational evaluation versus intake for therapy). However, it is important to consider when efficiency should be prioritized over breadth of the interview, particularly if speaking with additional informants will unnecessarily delay the initiation of treatment, provide only minimal <span id="ITerm24">additional </span>information, or increase the cost of services.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Remote Evaluation Considerations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par15">During <span id="ITerm25">and</span> following the <span id="ITerm26">COVID-19 pandemic</span>, many mental health services for youth have been effectively delivered remotely or via telehealth. Assessments conducted via telehealth hold many advantages, including increased access to care and environmental information, but they also introduce additional considerations for how evaluations are conducted. <span id="ITerm27">Telehealth</span> options for assessment eliminate some barriers to assessment, in the sense that time and transportation concerns are somewhat minimized. Telehealth delivery also broadens the scope of assessments by allowing clinicians to gather other information relevant to the home environment. For example, in-home telehealth services can be helpful in the visualization of a child’s home environment, which may supplement clinical observation throughout an interview (e.g., asking a child with suspected hoarding disorder to show you their bedroom for better assessment).</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">The nature of <span id="ITerm28">remote </span>assessments, held in a space uncontrolled by clinicians, also necessitates consideration for client confidentiality and child behavior management. As is true for in-clinic assessments, when conducting telehealth assessments, it is important to prioritize client privacy and adhere to <span id="ITerm29">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</span> regulations for <span id="ITerm30">videoconferencing</span>. Planning for any safety concerns is also warranted. This can be done by confirming the address where the child and family are located and the nearest emergency room and ensuring adult supervision for emergencies. Given state licensing requirements, it is also required that the clinician confirm that they and the client are in a state in <span id="ITerm31">which</span> the provider is licensed. The relative location of the child’s <span id="ITerm32">caregiver</span> to the child during a telehealth interview should also be established and rules about whether and when a caregiver must be present in the house or near the device used should be clarified at the outset.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">It is worth noting that a caveat of telehealth <span id="ITerm33">care</span> is its reliance on consistent home internet access and devices. Many households lack stable or high-speed internet services, and some families have no access at all. Engaging in discussions with caregivers about transportation accessibility and technological resources prior to the assessment can provide clinicians with insights into the appropriateness of telehealth <span id="ITerm34">evaluations</span> for a particular family.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">General Interview Guidelines</h3><p class="Para" id="Par18">The goal of a diagnostic <span id="ITerm35">interview</span> is typically to identify the primary concern(s), assign a diagnosis, and develop an initial plan for intervention or treatment. To do this, the diagnostic interview should provide information that will be helpful for developing a case conceptualization. That is, the interview should provide the clinician with information about possible preceding and maintaining factors of the child’s current concerns to identify targets for intervention. Therefore, the interview should not only collect information necessary to diagnose but also to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">treat</em>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">The type or format of the interview will depend on the setting, the available time, the referral question, and the purpose of the interview. Clinicians may choose to conduct an unstructured interview, a semi-structured interview, or a structured interview. Each of these confers different advantages and disadvantages and may require different levels of familiarity and skill to be administered effectively.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">Despite their name, <span id="ITerm36">unstructured</span> interviews typically involve a structure laid out by the interviewer with questions posed to the client (child and/or caregiver). Unstructured interviews do not utilize a single standardized format, which allows questions to be asked in any order, added, or omitted, as desired. The accuracy of diagnoses established through unstructured interviews can vary depending on the skill of the interview and the interviewer’s thoroughness in obtaining information necessary to confirm whether certain diagnostic criteria are met. The primary advantage of an unstructured interview is that it often follows the flow of a natural conversation, and this style can facilitate development of rapport and trust between the interviewer and interviewee by creating a sense of comfort during the interview process. <span id="ITerm37">However</span>, unstructured interviews tend to be narrow and hypothesis-driven, which leads to significant limitations for obtaining diagnostic accuracy and interrater reliability.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">Semi-structured interviews provide guidelines for questions to be asked and follow-up prompts for further information to assess the child and determine a diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews may include suggested questions and probes, but these types of interviews allow the clinician flexibility to ask additional questions and discuss other relevant information. While semi-structured interviews appear to improve diagnostic reliability, they may be more time-consuming and require additional training.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">Structured <span id="ITerm38">interviews</span> follow more rigid rules, with questions being presented in a specific order, utilizing strict skip-out and follow-up rules (i.e., “if yes, proceed to next question; if no, proceed to next section”). They minimize variability and bias from the clinician and can provide information that is more objective. Such tools are often preferable in research settings that require interrater reliability and accuracy of diagnoses. Furthermore, because follow-up probes and questions are typically not included within the interview, they can often be conducted in a shorter period. However, structured interviews may not capture critical information necessary for a diagnosis, particularly where children have more limited insight. Structured interviews capture the presence or absence of specific symptoms, but they may not capture information necessary for understanding the preceding and maintaining factors of the child’s presenting problem, which is critical for differential diagnosis, developing a case conceptualization, <span id="ITerm39">and</span> establishing a treatment strategy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Regardless of the style of diagnostic interview employed, to facilitate an open and honest discussion, rapport building is an essential first step when meeting with a <span id="ITerm40">caregiver</span> or a child. Diagnostic interviewing often involves discussing difficult topics and sharing personal information. It is the responsibility of the interviewer to create a warm and supportive atmosphere; without such an atmosphere, children and their caregivers may be less willing to share information freely and answer questions openly. Several minutes should be set aside for rapport building with the child and with the <span id="ITerm41">caregiver</span> to allow them to share general information about themselves or discuss topics that are unrelated to <span id="ITerm42">the </span>reason for the clinic visit, as they acclimate to the interviewer and clinic setting. Asking children about things they enjoy can be a helpful way to make them feel listened to during the initial stages of an interview or to further personalize the interaction throughout. Many of the initial rapport building strategies remain the same for virtual evaluations such as asking a child about a character on their T-shirt or asking about school. During a <span id="ITerm43">telehealth</span> evaluation, there is an added opportunity to ask about room decor or a pet that can be heard in the background. Clinicians can also choose to use more expressive movements or nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expressions), emoji video reaction options, or other facets of the virtual environment (e.g., watching a preferred brief video as a reinforcer) to foster a deeper sense of <span id="ITerm44">engagement</span> with the child. Another strategy to provide a supportive and welcoming environment is to introduce the steps of the interview or intake process with the caregiver and/or with the child. For many families, the diagnostic interview may be their first experience with a mental health professional, so proving clear information about the process and creating a welcoming environment can reduce anxiety about the experience.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">The order in which children and <span id="ITerm45">caregivers</span> are interviewed can also impact the experience of the client and the type of information obtained by the clinician. Depending on the nature of the referral question and the family dynamic, it may be preferable to meet with the child first to obtain information and build rapport. In cases where there is conflict or discrepancy between the caregiver and child, interviewing <span id="ITerm46">the</span> caregiver first may put the child on the defensive and may make them feel as though the clinician has aligned with the caregiver. In some cases, it may be appropriate to interview the caregiver first if, for example, the service being provided will be focused on the caregivers (e.g., caregiver management training), or if the child is younger. However, in situations where the child will be the focus of services (e.g., child-focused therapy), maintaining rapport with the child through the intake process is important.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">When meeting with the child, it is critical to set aside the necessary time to build rapport and address any concerns they may have about the assessment and treatment process. This is particularly important if the clinician conducting the diagnostic interview will oversee future treatment. In this case, the <span id="ITerm47">evaluation </span>is often the first meeting between the child and the clinician, so developing rapport and making the child feel comfortable sets the stage for a good therapeutic alliance. Meeting alone with the child also allows them the opportunity to speak freely about things they may not be comfortable discussing in front of <span id="ITerm48">caregivers</span> and to understand the child’s perspective about the presenting problems. Children can be valuable sources of information regarding caregiver behaviors and strategies for managing the child’s presenting symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">It is also important when meeting with families to not only establish confidentiality within the clinical setting but also to discuss issues of privacy relating to information that the child shares with the therapist, particularly for older children and adolescents. While caregivers have the right to know most information for children under age 18, it is important to briefly discuss with the <span id="ITerm49">caregiver</span> and child what <span id="ITerm50">information</span> is necessary to share, and how this information will be shared. Of course, it is important to establish that information that may jeopardize the safety or well-being of the child must be shared with the caregiver, and all applicable regulations and codes regarding reporting of such information must be followed. However, many children may be struggling with issues that they are worried about discussing with their caregivers, such as sexual or gender identity, abuse, or sensitive peer issues; creating an environment in which the child feels comfortable sharing these concerns with the clinician is helpful for obtaining a complete diagnostic and clinical picture.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">It may also be important to interview the <span id="ITerm51">caregiver(s)</span> alone to obtain information about the child’s developmental history, <span id="ITerm52">the</span> history of presenting concerns, and family psychiatric history. While meeting with the caregivers, the clinician can discuss the assessment process and treatment, as well as provide information about what can be expected during both. Many caregivers may feel anxious and have questions about their child’s problems, so listening openly and providing reassurance to caregivers are crucial during the diagnostic interview. Finally, to the degree that it is important to the evaluation, an opportunity to meet with and observe the <span id="ITerm53">child</span> and the <span id="ITerm54">caregiver</span> together can be helpful for understanding the family dynamic. This meeting can be brief and can take place during the initial introduction at the start of the visit, or it can be more extensive depending on the information required by the clinician. Sometimes, a very brief observation can be sufficient, particularly in cases where there is obvious tension between the caregiver and the child. In these situations, navigating the diagnostic interview carefully is critical to obtain the perspective of <span id="ITerm55">the </span>caregiver and the child independently.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Direct Observations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par28">Observing <span id="ITerm56">behavior</span> in various environments can be a useful source of data for establishing child diagnoses and developing a case conceptualization. Direct observation of the child can take place in more naturalistic environments, including the home or school. Using direct observation, the clinician can identify factors in the environment that contribute to the child’s behavior or maintain problematic behavior. In addition, through naturalistic observation, the clinician can identify antecedents or consequents of presenting concerns or targets for intervention in the environment. Direct observation can take place formally, using structured coding systems or functional assessment tools, or informally. In either case, it is important for the observer to establish the purpose and the focus of the observation to <span id="ITerm57">obtain</span> useful data and consider whether an observation is necessary for the interview process, as this often requires significant time and may be costly for families.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Observations may take place in the home or the school, although they should ideally be done unobtrusively or virtually, where possible. While observing the child in the home can be useful for obtaining information about the family dynamic or home environment, it is often difficult to do this, as the presence of an observer in the home may change the family’s behavior and/or may produce a more socially desirable presentation. Therefore, obtaining information about the family dynamic in the clinic is often a suitable alternative.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">Observing the child in the <span id="ITerm58">school</span> may be especially relevant in situations where the presenting concerns are most impairing in this setting. To ensure natural behavior, it is often best to have the clinician send someone who the child does not recognize, when possible. If the clinician has not yet met the child, they may be able to conduct the observation. It is necessary to obtain caregiver permission to conduct such an observation and to communicate with the child’s school to set up the observation and ensure that the school does not notify the child they are being observed. For a summary of information that can be obtained through <span id="ITerm59">direct</span> observation, see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">18.1</a></span>.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Additional Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par31">In some cases, it may be <span id="ITerm60">relevant</span> to communicate with other healthcare or mental health providers to get information pertinent to the child’s presenting problems. Prior to such communication, it is necessary to have the <span id="ITerm61">caregiver</span> provide a release to speak with other professionals who have seen the child. Speaking with physicians who have treated the child can help the clinician understand the interaction between medical and psychological concerns, which may be relevant for distinguishing somatic symptoms from those that result from an underlying biological condition. Primary care physicians can also provide information about the child’s medical and developmental history. To facilitate communication with physicians, who may work on a different schedule than therapists, it may be helpful to have the families alert the provider in advance of the clinician’s efforts to reach them. To reduce the burden on clinicians, families can also obtain copies of relevant medical records to share for assessment purposes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Speaking with other <span id="ITerm62">care </span>providers, including psychiatrists or previous therapists, is also helpful to understand the presenting problems and prior treatment efforts and establish strategies that have or have not been helpful for the child. This also opens a channel of communication between the interviewing clinician and other therapists or doctors who may be treating the child concurrently. Finally, depending on the referral question and the nature of the assessment, it may be necessary to use additional standardized tools, including cognitive and achievement tests, behavior rating scales, and personality inventories. These approaches are discussed later in the chapter.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading">Recommendations for Formal Assessment</h2><p class="Para" id="Par33">In addition to <span id="ITerm63">interviewing </span>and observing children, several standardized assessment tools can complement the evaluation by providing quantitative information in varying domains. If diagnostic accuracy is the goal, such standardized tools are preferable. Assessment tools include those designed to evaluate cognitive abilities, academic achievement, and behavior rating scales that screen for a variety of problems (i.e., wide band scales) and those that assess specific symptom domains (i.e., narrow band assessment scales). If the goal is diagnostic accuracy, it is recommended that the clinician has good knowledge of the DSM-5-TR and utilizes either a semi-structured or structured interview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">Cognitive and achievement measures are utilized primarily in the process of psychoeducational evaluation. Cognitive assessments provide information about a child’s intellectual functioning, often <span id="ITerm64">relative</span> to performance in academic domains, and are important for establishing diagnoses related to neurodevelopmental concerns. Commonly used cognitive measures include the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-5; Wechsler, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>), the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV; Wechsler, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>), and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II-NU; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Cognitive ability measures are often used in conjunction with measures of academic achievement to determine whether there is a discrepancy between a child’s ability (i.e., IQ) and achievement. Such information can be gathered by administering achievement measures such as the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement (WJ-V ACH; Schrank et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a></span>) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-IV; Wechsler, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). These tools are typically necessary for the diagnosis of a specific learning disorder.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Personality assessment <span id="ITerm65">can</span> be used to obtain data on unobservable or internal psychological processes that are not thought to be context-dependent or time bound, which may be the case for symptoms of a mental disorder. The most widely known tool for personality assessment in youth is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory for Adolescents Restructured Form (MMPI-A-RF; Archer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), which is considered a multidimensional assessment tool with 48 empirically validated subscales (e.g., Anxiety, Cynicism, Negative Peer Influence). Such tools often require extensive training to interpret, are most appropriate for older youth, and involve several hundred questions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Broad measures that assess children’s functioning across multiple domains and include multiple subscales are <span id="ITerm66">often</span> important for comprehensive screening in clinical settings. Examples of such tools include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL<span id="ITerm67"/>; Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-<span id="ITerm68">3</span>; Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). Both the CBCL and BASC-3 include preschool, school age, adolescent, and young adult versions of the parent report measure, as well as corresponding teacher-report forms. In addition, self-report versions of the tools are available for older children (ages 8 and older for the BASC-3, ages 11 and older for the CBCL), as well as forms for conducting behavioral observations of children. Broad measures can be a useful strategy for obtaining information from teachers and for confirming information obtained through the diagnostic interview. In addition, such tools can be used to screen for other disorders that may not have been heavily discussed during the clinical interview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37"><span id="ITerm69">Narrow-band assessment</span><span id="ITerm70"/> tools are those that measure specific sets of symptoms or clinical phenomena. Such tools are useful for quantifying the presence of symptoms within a specific problem area, measuring specific information about problem severity, and/or tracking symptom change over the course of treatment (i.e., progress monitoring). A common example of such a tool is the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADRS; Wolraich et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>), which is a rating scale used to assess symptoms of <span id="ITerm71">ADHD</span> in children ages 6–12 and screen for other externalizing disorders. The measure includes both a parent and teacher version. A follow-up form to assess symptom change and side effects of medication is also available. Another example of a <span id="ITerm72">narrow-band assessment</span> tool is the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>), which is a questionnaire that <span id="ITerm73">assesses</span> internalizing disorders, including anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The <span id="ITerm74">RCADS</span> is available in parent- and self-rated versions, as well as short-forms of the measure, and it has been normed on children in grades 3–12.</p><div class="Para" id="Par38">While broad-band and narrow-band assessment tools can be useful for establishing a diagnosis and case conceptualization, such instruments should be selected carefully. Clinicians must consider whether the assessment tool has been standardized for use with children of the appropriate age and population. Furthermore, it is important to consider available literature and research on the measure to facilitate accurate interpretation and determine if the measure’s psychometric properties are suitable (i.e., the instrument measures what it intends to measure and it has adequate internal <span id="ITerm75">consistency</span> and adequate test-retest reliability, if relevant). Clinicians should also consider the feasibility of having <span id="ITerm76">caregivers</span> and children complete rating scales, especially if additive to diagnostic interviews. Some caregivers may be overwhelmed or burdened by having to complete longer assessment scales. Children’s developmental level may also inform whether they can appropriately complete a rating scale; a child with reading difficulties, for example, may struggle to finish a self-report questionnaire. When selecting which measures to administer and to whom, clinicians should be sensitive to the needs of the family and the child, a measure’s cultural appropriateness, and avoid unnecessarily or inappropriately burdening <span id="ITerm77">the</span> family.

These interviews are advantageous in research settings and settings where clinician variability and bias need to be reduced. While they may reduce the time required to completing intake interviews, additional questions may be necessary for obtaining idiographic information to personalize treatment. Several widely available structured interviews for children and their caregivers are detailed below.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">The MINI-Kid</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par40">The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and <span id="ITerm80">Adolescents</span><span id="ITerm81"/> (MINI-Kid; Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>) is a structured diagnostic interview to assess the presence of DSM-5 diagnoses in children and adolescents ages 6–17. It assesses the 30 most common and clinically relevant diagnoses in children and adolescents. The MINI-Kid was designed as a more efficient diagnostic tool for clinical and research settings and uses a branching format to determine which items must be administered. It is available in a standard child version, which can be administered to the child and <span id="ITerm82">caregiver</span> together, with the questions directed to the child while the caregiver is asked to respond only when they believe the child has not provided accurate information. The parent version of the interview can be used when the caregiver is interviewed alone about the child. In addition, a screening version of the tool is available to facilitate shorter interviews by allowing the clinician to determine <span id="ITerm83">which</span><span id="ITerm84"/> additional sections of the MINI to administer. Where additional detail is needed, several non-standard versions are available for use, including the MINI-Kid for Psychotic Disorders Studies, the MINI Kid with Tobacco Use Disorder Module, and the MINI-Kid for Suicidality Disorders Studies. To track treatment progress over time, the MINI-Kid Tracking version converts yes/no responses into dimensional options to assess the severity of each symptom.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">Although no standardized training is offered in the MINI-Kid, individuals with clinical training can use the tool after a brief session of instruction in the measure. For those with less clinical experience, more extensive training is required. The MINI-Kid has been shown to be highly concordant with other semi-structured interview tools that require additional time to administer (i.e., Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children—Present and Lifetime Version; K-SADS-PL; Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). However, concordance of the MINI-Kid and K-SADS-PL in <span id="ITerm85">psychotic </span><span id="ITerm86"/>disorders was shown to be more variable. The interview’s ability to detect the presence of disorder (i.e., sensitivity) was adequate for 15 of 20 individual disorders in the DSM-IV version of the interview. In addition, the MINI-Kid had good ability to detect those without diagnoses (i.e., specificity) for all 20 diagnoses in the DSM-IV version of the measure. More recently, psychometrics studies revisiting the test-retest reliability of the MINI-Kid found that although the reliability values were lower than in the initial psychometrics study (Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>), they still fell in the achievable and acceptable range and were higher than the average reliability values from a summary of 15 studies across various other assessment tools (Duncan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>; Boyle et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). The latest version of the assessment, the MINI-Kid English Version 7.0.2, has been revised to parallel changes made to the DSM-5; alongside it, the Adolescent MINI Kid for Suicidality Disorders Studies (MINI-Kid-SD; Sheehan &amp; Giddens, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>) has been released as an adjunct to the standard MINI-Kid <span id="ITerm87">modules </span><span id="ITerm88"/>to facilitate differentiation between suicidality disorder phenotypes (e.g., Impulse Attack Suicidality Disorder, Psychotic Suicidality Disorder).</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar3"><div class="Heading">Semi-Structured Interviews</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par42"><span id="ITerm89">Semi-structured interviews</span> can be utilized as a guideline for clinical interviewing. Such interviews include predetermined questions that may serve as a suggestion for interviewers, or as a basis for continued follow-up questions. While semi-structured interviews may reduce variability and clinician bias, the flexibility conferred by such an approach may require additional training to reach reliability and may further extend the time required for administration. Several semi-structured interview tools are reviewed next.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar4"><div class="Heading">The DIAMOND-KID</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par43">The Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and OCD and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Child and Adolescent Version (DIAMOND-KID; Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>) is a <span id="ITerm90">semi-structured</span> interview designed for children and adolescents, which derives from the adult DIAMOND assessment (Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). The DIAMOND-KID relies on developmentally appropriate language and, occasionally, other informants’ input to screen for DSM-5 diagnoses in youth ages 6–17. This clinical interview also includes over 40 clinically relevant diagnoses to examine differential diagnoses and asses a wider range of conditions. The DIAMOND-KID can be administered to the child alone, or to the child with a <span id="ITerm91">caregiver</span> present; before each diagnostic section, guidance is provided as to who is the best source of information. Currently, the DIAMOND-KID is offered in English, Arabic, Spanish, and Hebrew, with ongoing efforts to translate it into additional languages.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">The <span id="ITerm92">DIAMOND-KID</span> was designed as a more efficient diagnostic tool for clinical and research settings that prioritizes a thorough understanding of symptomatology while still adhering to a relatively short administration time. This is achieved through proposed clarifying questions that probe at symptoms endorsed, distress and impairment questions that efficiently rule out subclinical symptoms, and information on common differential diagnoses, adapted from the DSM-5, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Because of the DIAMOND-KID’s semi-structured nature, clinicians are given the liberty to determine when further questioning is needed and which sections of the interview to administer. Before the interview, clinicians can provide clients or caregivers with a DIAMOND-KID screening form. <span id="ITerm93">This</span> can assist in identifying main concerns, potentially reducing the duration of the assessment. By employing “skip” rules, where clinicians advance to the next diagnosis if the client does not meet necessary criteria, the assessment can typically be administered to most patients in about 1 h. When examining psychometrics, the DIAMOND-KID demonstrated strong reliability with very good to excellent internal consistency according to the standards set by DSM-5 field trials (Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>; Clarke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). It is worth noting that interrater reliability for some internalizing disorders was found questionable in youth (Tolin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>), possibly due to reliance on <span id="ITerm94">specific</span> time frames for youth diagnoses.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar5"><div class="Heading">K-SADS</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par45">The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; Chambers et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a></span>) <span id="ITerm95">is</span><span id="ITerm96"/> a semi-structured interview, appropriate for children and adolescents ages 6–18 years old. Currently, only the Present/Lifetime version of the interview (K-SADS-PL DSM-5; Kaufman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) and the web-based computerized versions of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADS-COMP; Townsend et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>) are updated for DSM-5 criteria. The K-SADS-PL assesses the presence of symptoms over the course of the child’s lifetime and at the time of the interview. Consistent with dimensional measures available in the DSM-5, the updated K-SADS-PL includes crosscutting dimensional rating scales completed by the caregiver and the child prior to the interview, which can be utilized to inform diagnosis and case conceptualization. The interview includes modules which assess for affective <span id="ITerm97">disorders</span><span id="ITerm98"/>, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, stress-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., tic disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder). It also includes a 10- to 15-min unstructured section to facilitate rapport building and obtain information about the presenting concerns. A set of screening interview questions are utilized to survey the presence of primary symptoms for all diagnoses. Based on symptoms endorsed, the appropriate interview supplements are then administered to the caregiver and/or the child.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Within the <span id="ITerm99">interview</span><span id="ITerm100"/>, probes to facilitate rating of items are provided as guidelines to the clinician, though these are not intended to be read verbatim. Once sufficient information for the item has been obtained, symptoms are rated on a 0 to 3 scale by the clinician, with 0 indicating no information and 3 indicating that the symptom meets or exceeds threshold (Kaufman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). Final diagnoses are determined based on child and caregiver ratings, and it is recommended that interviewers use clinical judgment when discrepancies between caregiver and child report are present.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">In total, the interview is estimated to take two and a half hours for both the child and caregiver portion. Research training for the measure involves a two-day didactic training followed by post-training reliability checks and consultation. Although psychometric data is not yet available for the DSM-5 <span id="ITerm101">version</span><span id="ITerm102"/> of the K-SADS-PL in English, psychometric data on the Turkish DSM-5 adaptation, as well as the Japanese DSM-5 adaptation, have shown very good interrater reliability and good construct validity (Ünal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>; Nishiyama et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). An Icelandic version of the K-SADS-PL DSM-5 was studied for the test-retest validity of the updated assessment; most disorders demonstrated excellent reliability except for chronic motor or vocal tic disorder which showed poor reliability (Hannesson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Additionally, psychometric data on the KSADS-COMP reported that the computerized version had a strong convergent validity, and high interrater reliability for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, <span id="ITerm103">and</span><span id="ITerm104"/> conduct disorder (Townsend et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar6"><div class="Heading">ADIS-5-C/P</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par48">The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5, Child and Parent version (ADIS-5<span id="ITerm105">-C/P</span><span id="ITerm106"/>; Silverman &amp; Albano, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>), is a commonly used semi-structured interview used for differential diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders, which also screens for other disorders and comorbidities. The interview can be administered to children ages 6–18 years old and their caregivers and has recently been updated for the DSM-5. Given the semi-structured format, questions provided are considered by the authors to be guidelines and are not required to be read verbatim. Additional phrasing suggestions for adjusting questions to the child’s developmental level are also provided in the text. Each section of the interview includes a question to assess impairment, rated from 0 to 8 (8 being the highest level of impairment); impairment ratings are obtained from the caregiver and child separately. Although guidelines are available for establishing <span id="ITerm107">composite</span><span id="ITerm108"/> diagnoses in cases where caregiver and child reports differ, flexibility and the use of clinical judgment are recommended. Once diagnoses are assigned, each one is then assigned a <span id="ITerm109">Clinical Severity Rating (CSR)</span> by the clinician. It is recommended that interviewers review composite diagnoses and assign CSRs with a consensus team or supervisor. Seeing as the ADIS-5-C/P is a recent update, documentation of its translations is not yet available. However, the previous version, ADIS-IV-C/P (Silverman &amp; Albano, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>), has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.</p><div class="Para" id="Par49">Due to the recency of the newest version, no psychometric papers have been published yet. However, several psychometric studies on the ADIS-IV-C/P demonstrate excellent test-retest reliability for combined diagnoses <span id="ITerm110">of </span><span id="ITerm111"/>anxiety disorders and anxiety disorder symptoms based on child and caregiver report, while test-retest reliability is good for externalizing disorders (Silverman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>). In addition, the anxiety disorders section of the interview has good concurrent validity with rating scales that measure social anxiety, panic disorder, and separation anxiety, but not with rating scales of generalized anxiety disorder (Wood et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>). With respect to interrater agreement, studies demonstrate that when interviewing both the caregiver and child, agreement on principal diagnoses and anxiety disorders is excellent, and agreement on comorbid disorders is good (Lyneham et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). In addition to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria update, an <span id="ITerm112">autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</span> addendum was developed to provide structured guidance on differentiating anxiety disorders and other, more distinct and ambiguous anxiety-like symptoms common in children with ASD (ADIS/ASA; Kerns et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The ADIS-5-C/P also introduces new features that facilitate assessment of milestones and key events in youth’s health, education, and development. <span id="ITerm113">Although </span><span id="ITerm114"/>no standard training procedure is required, training can be obtained from the authors of the ADIS-5-C/P. The authors recommend that raters participate in didactic training on the measure and diagnoses, followed by live or video coding of interviews. Finally, a co-rated interview with a trained diagnostician, followed by supervision or matching on diagnoses with the trainer or supervisor is recommended (Silverman &amp; Albano, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>; Silverman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>; Wood et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>).

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec12"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustration</h2><div class="Para" id="Par50">Katie is an 11-year-old White, Hispanic female referred by her parents for difficulties at <span id="ITerm119">home</span> and at school. Laura X, Katie’s mother, brought her in for the interview. Her father was not present for the evaluation. On the phone screen, Mrs. X noted that Katie had been having significant anxiety-related difficulty at home, particularly around sleeping and going to school in the morning. During the first meeting, the clinician attempted to gather information from Mrs. X regarding Katie’s difficulties, as well as develop an understanding of the antecedents and consequences around her behaviors, both at home and in other settings (e.g., school). The purpose of the case illustration is to demonstrate methods of building rapport and setting the stage for a structured diagnostic interview, which will not be presented here. However, if using a diagnostic interview, this interaction may be incorporated into the interview itself.<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone"><li><p class="Para" id="Par51"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Thank you for coming in today, X. What is the main reason you’re bringing Katie in today?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par52"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs. X</em>: Well, I’m <span id="ITerm120">just</span> really worried about Katie’s difficulties around going to sleep at night and going to school in the morning. It’s a constant battle and there are days where I just give in and let her stay home. At night, her father and I have just given in at this point. She’s sleeping in our bed every night and her younger brother—he’s seven—is sleeping alone in his room. So, I know this isn’t typical. I just want to make sure I get her the help that she needs.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par53"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: It sounds like you and Katie’s father are feeling pretty frustrated about this. So, it seems that Katie’s main areas of difficulty are around going to sleep alone and going to school in the morning. Does that sound right?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par54"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: We’re so frustrated, but also just worried about her! Yes, those are the two big areas, but really, other times that I try to leave her with a babysitter, or even with her <span id="ITerm121">grandmother</span>, she gets very upset and makes it very hard for us.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par55"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Oh, okay, so it sounds like really whenever you try to separate from her, she becomes pretty upset.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par56"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: Exactly.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par57"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: When you do get her to school, what’s she like at school?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par58"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: Oh, not good. She probably calls me or messages me on her iPad 3 to 5 times per day.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par59"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: And what do you usually do when she messages you?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par60"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: Well, I respond usually, unless I’m in a meeting or something. If I do take a while to respond, she starts getting even more upset and that usually leads her to go to the school nurse, who ends up calling me. So I usually try to answer as soon as I see it because I figure it’s probably better that she’s in her classroom, but I don’t know. It’s hard to keep up with this. At the most recent parent-teacher conference, I found out that she was getting B’s and C’s now and she’s always been a straight <span id="ITerm122">A</span> student, so I’m afraid that she’s really distracted in school.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="Para" id="Par61">Mrs. X’s description of the problem behaviors appears consistent with separation anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as defined in the DSM-5-TR. It is common with young children who present with anxiety concerns to exhibit symptoms consistent with more than one anxiety disorder. It is the goal of the diagnostic interview to obtain information to clarify the diagnosis. To be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, an individual must exhibit significant, developmentally inappropriate difficulty when separating from a loved one and this difficulty must be present for at least 4 weeks. These symptoms must cause clinically significant distress and impairment. To be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, an individual must exhibit significant worries in multiple domains (e.g., school, performance, safety). These worries must be present for at least 6 months and <span id="ITerm123">cause</span> clinically significant impairment. The clinician will attempt to obtain information about why Mrs. X believes that Katie is exhibiting these behaviors.<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone"><li><p class="Para" id="Par62"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Right, so it sounds like you’re really worried about how these behaviors are impacting her academic progress. You’re also struggling with how best to respond to her when she is checking in with you throughout the school day too. I wonder, do you have any ideas about what Katie is afraid of when separating from you? Has she mentioned why she needs to check in with you or why she wants to sleep in bed with you and dad?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par63"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: I don’t think so. I mean in terms of the sleeping, it’s really just habit at this point. I mean, we used to try to send her back to her bed, but she would just get really upset and cry hysterically. My husband and I always just assumed that she was scared, but we weren’t really sure what it was exactly that scared her. I mean we <span id="ITerm124">live</span> in a nice neighborhood, a gated community, so I can’t imagine that she’s afraid for her safety. But I don’t know.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par64"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: So, it sounds like you and her dad are not really sure what it is that makes her want to sleep with you at night. What about her difficulty going to school in the morning? Do you have any ideas about what is causing that?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par65"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: I’m not sure about that either. She does tell me that she’s going to miss me, and she asks me a lot of questions about what I’m going to be doing that day, when I will pick her up, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">if</em> I will pick her up or not. So, I don’t know, maybe she just doesn’t want <span id="ITerm125">to</span> be away from me? Maybe she’s worried that I’ll forget her? That’s never happened though!</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par66"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: So, it sounds like maybe we have a little more insight into her difficulty going to school in the morning. Perhaps it’s because she doesn’t want to be separated from you, or maybe she’s worried about being left at school.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par67"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs. X</em>: Right.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par68"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Okay—well thank you so much for all of that information. It’s very common to be unclear about why young kids have difficulties in certain situations. It sounds like you have some good hypotheses though and we’re going to ask Katie many different questions to try to get a sense from her about what makes these things difficult. Does that sound okay to you?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par69"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mrs</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">X</em>: Yes, absolutely.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="Para" id="Par70">Caregivers often do not <span id="ITerm126">fully </span>understand the cause of some of their children’s avoidance behaviors. As such, it is very important to try to obtain this information from the child directly. Next, the clinician brought Katie into the room. With children, behavioral observations at the time of separation from the caregiver can provide important information, especially when there are symptoms of separation anxiety. Katie was noted to ask her mother multiple questions, including “Where will you be sitting?” and “Are you going to leave?” Mrs. X responded to her questions, letting her know that she would be in the waiting room and that Katie could check on her if needed. Katie appeared reassured by Mrs. X’s responses and was able to stay in the room with the clinician. The interview started with some general rapport building with Katie, as well as an explanation of the rewards that Katie could earn by engaging with the interviewer. With children, a reinforcement system may be necessary to keep the child engaged in <span id="ITerm127">the</span> interview process, as some questions may elicit strong emotions in the child or cover difficult topics. Katie was easily engaged with the interviewer and rapport was easily established. As such, the interview moved into an open-ended conversation with Katie regarding her perception of the presenting problem.<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone"><li><p class="Para" id="Par71"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Why do you think you’re here today, Katie?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par72"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: I don’t know.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par73"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Well, why do you think mom brought you in today?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par74"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Um, I think she wants me to sleep in my own bed.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par75"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Thanks for telling me that! So, it sounds like maybe mom wants you to sleep in your bed. What makes sleeping in your own bed hard?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par76"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: I just don’t like it. I like sleeping with mommy and daddy.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par77"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: It sounds like you just like it more in there. I understand that. Well, today <span id="ITerm128">we’re</span> going to talk a lot more about that and I’m going to ask you a bunch of different questions that have to do with feeling anxious, nervous, or sad. Some of those questions are going to sound like you, and we’ll spend a lot more time talking about those things. Does that sound okay to you?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="Para" id="Par78">Katie’s description of the presenting problem was consistent with what was discussed by Mrs. X. The clinician hypothesized that Katie’s unwillingness to sleep in her own bed may be related to anxiety. However, at this point in the interview, it was appropriate to accept the child’s explanation for the problem (e.g., just not liking sleeping in her own bed). As the child builds rapport with the clinician, the clinician could become more pointed in their questions regarding the reason for sleeping in <span id="ITerm129">her</span> caregivers’ bed. The clinician used the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 Child/Parent version (ADIS-5-C/P). This interview was administered to Katie alone and took approximately 90 minutes. Followed by a 10-min break, the interview was then administered to Mrs. X and took approximately 90 min. A portion of the separation anxiety disorder section and Katie’s answers are provided:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone"><li><p class="Para" id="Par79"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Some children worry a lot about being away from their parents or from home. Do you feel very scared or worried when you are away from mom or dad and do whatever you can to be with them?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par80"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Yes.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par81"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Thanks for telling me that! Do you get really upset, cry, or beg your parents to stay home when they plan to go somewhere without you?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par82"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Yes! I hate it when they try to go to dinner without me.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par83"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Thanks <span id="ITerm130">for </span>letting me know! Why do you think you hate it?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par84"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: I just miss them and sometimes I get scared that something bad might happen to them. Like what if they get into a car accident or something?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par85"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: So, you miss them a lot and get scared that something bad might happen. I can see why that would make you want them to stay home! When your parents do leave, do you cry or feel very bad because you miss them a lot?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par86"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: I miss them a lot! I use my iPad to text mom and dad and that makes me feel better when they answer because I know that they’re okay.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par87"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Oh, okay—so you use your iPad to check in on them. Are there other times where <span id="ITerm131">you</span> check in on mom and dad when you’re not with them?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par88"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Sometimes I message mom when I’m at school too, but not that much.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par89"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Thanks for telling me that. Why do you think that you need to check in on mom when you’re in school?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par90"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Well, I just want to make sure that she’s okay and I like to know where she is. Sometimes, she leaves the house to go places, and that makes me nervous that she’s going to get hurt or something. I don’t know.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par91"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: So sometimes, you get worried about how mom is even when you’re at school. Is that right?</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par92"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Katie</em>: Yea. I’m always worried about mom when I’m not with her. I love her so much.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par93"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinician</em>: Yea it sounds <span id="ITerm132">like </span>you care about mom a lot!</p></li></ul></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par94">The semi-structured interview format allowed the clinician to ask follow-up questions after the child’s “yes” or “no” response. Given what the clinician knew from the interview with Mrs. X, the clinician was able to expand on Katie’s responses to gather clarifying information regarding the cause of some of Katie’s behaviors. After the interview with Katie, the clinician completed the ADIS-5-C/P with Mrs. X to gather more information.</p><p class="Para" id="Par95">When making the diagnosis, the clinician brought together the information obtained from Mrs. X and Katie, as well as behavioral observations. It was clear from the interviews that Katie’s behaviors were consistent with a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Mrs. X noted that these behaviors (e.g., difficulty sleeping on <span id="ITerm133">her </span>own, distress at separation, and checking on her parents when separated) had been present for greater than 4 weeks and were causing her significant distress and impairment. Katie explained that her difficulty separating was related to her fear that something bad would happen to her parents. Using the ADIS-5-C/P, the clinician was also able to rule out other comorbid diagnoses (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder). Katie denied significant worries in any other domain other than worrying about her parents’ safety. Mrs. X also denied any other significant areas of worry. Because of this, the clinician diagnosed Katie with separation anxiety disorder and offered Mrs. X several recommendations for addressing these concerns, <span id="ITerm134">including</span> individual cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec13"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par96">When assessing and <span id="ITerm135">diagnosing</span> children, it is essential to consider the child in context, understanding the systems and environments where they interact, as well as the cultural and developmental context unique to the individual. First, an understanding of developmental milestones and functioning across childhood is essential for any competent clinician working with children. Becoming familiar with development from early childhood through late adolescence or early adulthood is important in establishing a baseline for typical functioning against which to compare children whose functioning may be impaired by presenting concerns. Without such an understanding, it is difficult to determine whether a child’s behavior or functioning is indicative of psychopathology. For example, many young children present with fears of the dark, which is considered developmentally appropriate during early childhood and therefore would not be deemed pathological, particularly in situations where this fear did not result in significant impairment. On the other hand, an <span id="ITerm136">adolescent </span>afraid of the dark who requires a caregiver to accompany them to the bathroom at night demonstrates a developmentally atypical fear, which may be causing impairment in the home.</p><p class="Para" id="Par97">Cultural considerations are equally important in assessing developmental appropriateness, as cultural factors can influence perceptions of what is deemed appropriate. For example, studies suggest cultural and ethnic variations in maternal expectations of developmental milestones, with some cultures tending to anticipate their children achieving personal and social milestones at later stages or reporting socio-communication concerns at a lower rate than other cultural groups; this, in turn, directly affects how clinicians administer and conceptualize diagnostic interviews (Zuckerman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Many clinicians receive limited exposure to typically developing children or children outside of clinical settings. Therefore, it is wise for clinicians to seek opportunities to interact with <span id="ITerm137">youth</span> of varying ages in various contexts including schools, camps, or community organizations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par98">In addition to understanding children’s development, clinicians must consider the child’s geo-social context. This includes local and regional culture—the community and school environment—as well as cultural and racial/ethnic issues that may inform the diagnostic assessment. Understanding local and community norms can be helpful for determining the impact of psychopathology on functioning. For example, in an urban environment, it may be quite common for older children and adolescents to take public transportation independently; a child who refuses to take public transportation due to anxiety suggests some level of impairment. A child in a rural or suburban community may rely on caregivers for transportation and would not be considered impaired by their avoidance of public transportation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par99">Factors such as race, ethnicity, culture, and gender significantly influence the diagnostic process. Symptom experience <span id="ITerm138">and </span>expression are shaped by language, culture, and social context (Kirmayer, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). During a clinical interview, verbal comprehension issues or linguistic misunderstandings between client and interviewer can directly impact clinical decisions. Cultural differences and family values may affect how families convey presenting concerns and symptoms. For instance, some clients may convey emotional distress by describing physical sensations that may not directly correspond with diagnostic criteria reliant on endorsement of specific emotional states; this may be the case for some clients of ethnic or racial groups where somatic symptoms are a more widely accepted or common form of <span id="ITerm139">expressing</span> psychological discomfort (Dunlop et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Awareness of culturally specific concerns is crucial in understanding how some families may perceive the diagnostic process and the types of information or services they seek. For example, in families or cultures where mental health care is heavily stigmatized or not trusted due to a history of racial and ethnic injustice, caregivers <span id="ITerm140">may</span> present seeking confirmation that a child does <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> have a diagnosis, or they may react defensively to receiving a formal diagnosis. Cultural values may also inform the attributions families and clinicians make for a child’s behavior or presenting symptoms. Some symptoms that the clinician considers problematic, or evidence of a disorder, may be thought of by the family as typical within the cultural or family context. For instance, in Western clinical settings, assertiveness and lack of externalized anxiety are often valued, but these norms may not align with non-Western cultures, where self-restraint and modest anxious social behavior may be normative (Okazaki et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>). While such behaviors may be seen as socially appropriate within their respective cultural contexts, a Western clinician might misinterpret them as signs of social or interpersonal deficits, potentially suggesting psychopathology.</p><p class="Para" id="Par100">It is important for clinicians to be mindful that most assessment instruments have been developed and normed within <span id="ITerm141">largely</span> white and Western samples. Keeping this in mind allows the clinician to more appropriately assess issues of diversity that may not be captured by structured or norm-referenced assessment tools. Rather than establishing preconceived boundaries and expectations for cultural differences, clinicians should ask openly about the role of culture and diversity during the diagnostic interview process. This can be done in an interview format by using tools like the DSM-5-TR’s Cultural Formulation Interview (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) or by simply asking the child and/or caregiver how they feel their culture or values may impact current concerns or treatment. In addition, clinicians should be attuned to historic as well as contemporary issues of culture and diversity that <span id="ITerm142">may </span>be embedded within the interview responses. Further information on cultural sensitivity and multicultural competence within diagnostic interviewing, as well as a framework for how clinicians can consider this in practice, is outlined by <span id="ITerm143">Johnson</span> and <span id="ITerm144">Tucker</span> (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>). Some additional resources for clinicians looking to establish a strong foundation on cultural considerations are the APA’s Multicultural Guidelines (American Psychological Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) and the APA’s Handbook of Multicultural Psychology (Leong et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par101">During a diagnostic interview, concerns about gender roles and norms, along with details about sexual and gender identity, may arise. It is crucial for clinicians to handle this sensitive personal information with care and to be mindful of its potential relevance when developing the case conceptualization. To effectively tailor treatment and conduct a comprehensive interview, clinicians must consider the unique experiences of clients who identify with marginalized communities, such as LGBTQIA+ <span id="ITerm145">youth</span>, young girls, and/or youth of color. For instance, sexual and gender minority youth often face unique stressors, such as a persistent fear of rejection based on their identity or chronic feelings of isolation from concealing their identity from family and friends (Hendricks &amp; Testa, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>; Herman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>; Wanta et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Clinicians should consider these factors when assessing whether a child’s anxiety or responses are excessive relative to their specific experiences with discrimination at home or school. Whenever asking about sexuality, gender identity, and/or gender discrimination (i.e., sexism, transphobia), clinicians should make extra efforts to respect the child’s privacy and honor any preferred pronouns or name provided by the child. Creating an affirming and respectful environment during the diagnostic interview is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">essential</em> for building rapport, fostering trust, and increasing diagnostic accuracy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par102">Finally, clinicians must <span id="ITerm146">be</span> aware that issues of diversity extend beyond race, religion, and gender. Even <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">within</em> cultural groups, there may be differences in values or experiences that are relevant to the diagnostic process. Broad categories like race and gender may not capture the varied experiences of children and their caregivers. It is important to consider the range of identities and experiences one child may have. Socioeconomic status, gender identity, sexual identity, disability status, and race/ethnicity are especially relevant to mental health, as the experience of living in poverty and/or being part of a marginalized or minority group may impose unique stressors for children and families. Clinicians must also develop an understanding of how these identities and experiences intersect for the individual or the family, and how this might <span id="ITerm147">inform</span> the diagnosis or interview process.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec14"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par103">The <span id="ITerm148">diagnostic</span> interview should consider various factors that are critical to making a diagnosis. Most importantly, the interviewer should obtain information about the frequency of the presenting symptoms, their severity, and their duration. When considering each of these three domains, the clinician should also assess the settings in which these symptoms occur and should evaluate whether there are certain settings in which the symptoms present more frequently or severely. To accomplish this, clinicians must be aware of factors such as caregiver-child interactions, structure in the home, and classroom variables (e.g., structure, seat placement), among others. By considering environmental factors that may impact symptom presentation, this would allow for more effective and specific treatment planning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par104">In addition to the child and caregiver perspective about presenting problems, clinicians should also obtain information from other individuals in the child’s life that may have information that would <span id="ITerm149">inform</span> the diagnosis. For school-related concerns, for example, information from the child’s teacher would be integral for making an appropriate diagnosis. When gathering information from various informants, it is important to identify individuals who spend a significant amount of time with the child (e.g., the homeroom teacher who sees the child each day, a caregiver that spends the majority of the time with the child), as these people are likely to provide the most useful information <span id="ITerm150">about</span> the child’s behavior over time.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec15"><h2 class="Heading">Dos and Don’ts</h2><p class="Para" id="Par105">Clinicians should spend time warming the child and caregiver up to the interview before beginning. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Do</em> spend time developing a visual schedule or reinforcement system that could serve as a motivator for the child to keep them on task. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Do</em> build in breaks throughout a long interview to keep the child engaged. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Do</em> express empathy and openness to the child and caregiver. While it is the goal of the clinician to use this information to arrive at a diagnosis and plan treatment, the interview process itself can be quite therapeutic for children and caregivers who have been struggling and are able to express themselves in a comfortable environment. Recognizing this allows the clinician to maintain a balance between facilitative skills while also obtaining important information.</p><p class="Para" id="Par106">Do <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> speak about the child’s behaviors in front of them without asking the child for their opinion. Do <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> speak down to the child or speak in words that are developmentally inappropriate (e.g., jargon). Avoid terms that may be unfamiliar to people outside the mental health field. Do <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">not</em> demonstrate or convey judgment or negative reactions to information provided by the family; this includes verbal reactions and nonverbal reactions.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec16"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par107">The purpose of this chapter was to provide students and clinicians with a central overview of the diagnostic interviewing process for children. It began with a summary of issues specific to children that should be considered during the interview and intake process. A discussion of interview techniques and structure followed, highlighting how to use the referral question, who to interview, and methods for gathering information. In addition, a case illustration and recommendations for formal assessment tools, as well as a brief review of structured and semi-structured diagnostic interviews, were discussed. Finally, a review of the impact of race, culture, age, and other diversity considerations in the context of diagnostic interviewing was provided, followed by a brief discussion of important dos and don’ts for interviewing. A well-conducted and thorough diagnostic interview requires both a keen awareness of diagnostic criteria and structured tools, as well as sufficiently developed clinical skills to facilitate a comfortable and open environment for the child and caregiver. These competencies allow the clinician to collect the necessary data and make families comfortable enough to share such data. It is crucial to remember that the diagnostic interview marks the beginning of case conceptualization and treatment planning; a thoughtful and well-informed interview will set the stage for a strong and supportive therapeutic alliance.</p></section>
