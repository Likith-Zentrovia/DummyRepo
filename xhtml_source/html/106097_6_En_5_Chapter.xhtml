The chapter serves as an overview of how cognitive or brain dysfunction can manifest in a diagnostic interview and also provides an introduction to neuropsychological interviewing for general clinical psychology students or students focusing on clinical neuropsychology. The chapter focuses on neuropsychological assessment with adults.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Before <span id="ITerm1">proceeding</span>, it may be helpful to cover some terminology. As of this writing, there are several terms used to describe the cognitive disorders that may be of concern to patients and clinicians: mild cognitive impairment, dementia, major neurocognitive disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder. “<span id="ITerm2">Dementia</span>” is a long-used term that refers to impairment in memory and one or more other cognitive domains, which is severe enough to interfere with one’s ability to perform <span id="ITerm3">instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),</span> such as managing money, medications, or transportation. The term “dementia” in itself only refers to this syndrome, and there are many underlying causes of this, with the most common being Alzheimer’s disease. “Dementia” and “Alzheimer’s disease” are often used interchangeably, which can be misleading, and patients often receive conflicting explanations of these terms. The term “mild cognitive impairment” refers to a decline in memory or other cognitive abilities that is not yet severe enough to interfere with IADLs. It is usually associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but it can be caused by other conditions as well.</p><div class="Para" id="Par4">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, Text Revision</em> (DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) uses the term “neurocognitive disorder,” which can be “major” or “mild.” This reflects how conditions other than Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., traumatic brain injuries) can cause cognitive impairment, particularly in younger adults. Also, by incorporating the terms “major” and “mild,” it highlighted the concept that patients with conditions such as <span id="ITerm4">Alzheimer’s disease</span> can have varying levels of cognitive impairment ranging from mild to major. This chapter will use all of these terms. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">5.1</a></span> provides an illustration of these terms.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_5_Chapter/106097_6_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.38em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 5.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Conceptualization of the terms major or mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and their underlying causes</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading">Part 1: Factors That Might Suggest to Any Psychologist That Cognitive or Brain Dysfunction May Be Occurring and the Need for a Neuropsychological Evaluation</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading">Behavioral Observations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par5">There are certain behaviors exhibited by patients that can suggest the presence of brain dysfunction and the need for further evaluation by a neuropsychologist. These observations are noted in a “Behavioral Observations” section of a report, and this section tends to be present in most mental health evaluations. The behaviors to note often overlap with what is typically included in a “Mental Status Exam,” and both labels are often used for this section of an assessment report. Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="106097_6_En_4_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">4</span></a></span> covers elements of the mental status exam in detail, so this chapter will only provide a brief overview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">When patients frequently repeat questions or seem to forget things you have told them (e.g., where the bathroom is, what time the appointment will be over), this suggests that a neurological disorder such as <span id="ITerm5">Alzheimer’s disease</span> may possibly be present. If this disease is indeed present, the patient may not be a good historian. When patients perseverate on a topic of conversation (i.e., have difficulty changing the topic of conversation) or give tangential or circumstantial answers to questions, this also suggests that a neurocognitive disorder may be present. Patients who are quick to anger or socially inappropriate, such as asking overly personal questions of the clinician, also may be experiencing changes to their brain. These behaviors are examples of disinhibition caused by damage to the frontal lobes from a brain injury or a disease process such as a brain tumor or frontotemporal degeneration. If the patient shows a face devoid of expression (i.e., a masked face), speech that is slow and quiet (i.e., hypophonic), and delayed answers to questions, this suggests that Parkinson’s disease may be present. If the patient seems easily angered, has depressed affect, and has uncontrollable movements (choreiform movements), they may have symptoms of <span id="ITerm6">Huntington’s disease</span>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">Other important behavioral observations from a neuropsychological standpoint include elements of speech such as fluency, comprehension, and word-finding. Patients may report, or show, “tip of the tongue” situations in which they struggle to find the words they want to use in conversation. Problems in these areas can indicate the presence of aphasia caused by a stroke or brain injury, or the beginnings of a progressive dementia such as primary progressive aphasia.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">During an interview, it is often useful to determine whether the patient is oriented to the current date, place, and situation. This can be done by asking patients to tell you the full date and assessing how well they understand the purpose of the appointment. If the patient cannot remember aspects of the current date, such as the month or year, they may have a set of symptoms indicative of neurocognitive disorders such as delirium or <span id="ITerm7">dementia</span>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">In summary, these are all elements of a mental status exam or behavioral observations that can indicate the presence of cognitive or brain dysfunction that will affect the diagnostic interview process and subsequent treatment. If problems are notably present, the patient should be referred to a neuropsychologist and/or a neurologist for further evaluation and intervention.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Relevant Medical or Neurological History</h3><div class="Para" id="Par10">Another factor that may surface and suggest cognitive dysfunction is when the patient reports any history of a neurological problem such as a head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or self-observed memory problem that has not been addressed by a neuropsychologist. For example, clinicians will often find that they are the first to discover that a patient has a history of <span id="ITerm8">traumatic brain injury (TBI)</span>. TBIs can have subtle or major effects on a person’s daily life, and evaluation of these cognitive sequelae can elucidate areas of strength as well as areas that may be a struggle for them. In the clinical interview, the clinician can discern whether the patient has a possible history of TBI by asking if the patient has ever had a head injury with a loss of consciousness and by asking a general open-ended question about what the patient is able to recall about the injury in question. These general questions may elicit specific details from the injury to help assess severity of the injury (i.e., mechanism of injury, and other parameters presented in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">5.1</a></span>). The severity of TBI, whether “Mild,” “Moderate,” or “Severe,” has been frequently classified using specific criteria, and these parameters, such as length of loss of consciousness, may assist in a clinician’s determination of whether to refer a patient to neuropsychology for further evaluation. Discretion must be used when considering severity of injury when interviewing a patient due to the potential presence of complicating factors at the time of the actual injury (e.g., pain medications, use of sedation, intubation, substance use, etc.). Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">5.1</a></span> outlines the principal criteria cited when classifying the severity of TBI.<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 5.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by severity <span id="ITerm9">range</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/><col class="tcol4 align-char"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity range</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Loss of consciousness (LOC)</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Length of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA)</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p class="SimplePara">Glasgow coma scale (GCS)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Mild TBI/concussion</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">&lt;30 min</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">&lt;24 h</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p class="SimplePara">13–15</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Moderate TBI</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">30 min to 24 h</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">1–7 days</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p class="SimplePara">9–12</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Severe TBI</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">>24 h</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">>7 days</p></td><td style=""><p class="SimplePara">3–8</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par11">To assist with identifying behavior in the clinical interview, if the patient has a suspected moderate to severe TBI, this can affect the interview process in several ways. The patient may have a low frustration tolerance and may get easily annoyed with questions that do not seem pertinent or important to them, or that are of a personal nature. On the other hand, there may be a lack of initiative or interest and a lack of engagement in the assessment process. Both of these presentations can be related to frontal lobe damage. Patients with severe TBIs<span id="ITerm10"/> can be slow to respond and slow to generate an answer to a question. This could be related to <span id="ITerm11">diffuse axonal injury (DAI)</span>, or the stretching and other damage to axons that occurs in a TBI. Sometimes the patient may also lack awareness of the severity of their cognitive deficits, resulting in use of a more structured approach to the interview as well as a detailed interview with a caregiver to obtain relevant historical information. In addition, memory problems may be present that interfere with the patient’s ability to learn new information or to recall recent information. When assessing for TBI, if the individual is reporting a history of TBI and is presenting with persistent cognitive problems, a full neuropsychological evaluation would be helpful in determining what deficits a person may have that resulted from a TBI. Referral for neuropsychological evaluation would lead to individualized recommendations to accommodate these deficits, including but not limited to real-life compensatory strategies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">Another form of brain injury that can impact a clinical interview is a history of stroke, or <span id="ITerm12">cerebrovascular accident (CVA)</span>. The clinician may find that a patient has had symptoms of strokes that may have left the patient with lingering deficits. Chief symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, sudden change in vision, sudden inability to speak or to understand others’ speech, sudden onset of severe headache pain, and, generally, any sudden change in behavior. Patients and professionals need to be aware of these symptoms and should seek treatment immediately if these symptoms are present. A clinician may see a patient who has experienced these symptoms in the last week, and the patient should be told to seek urgent or emergency treatment. Depending on the length of time since symptom onset, treatment can be given that opens up a closed artery or relieves pressure on the brain from a hemorrhaged blood vessel.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Impacts of Cognitive Symptoms on the Interview</h3><p class="Para" id="Par13">If the clinician finds that a patient may have a neurocognitive disorder, or if this is known from a prior neuropsychological evaluation, then there are some ramifications for the successful completion of the interview. The patient may be a poor historian, providing inaccurate information. Sometimes patients give little behavioral indication of dementia, and the clinician assumes the patient’s report to be accurate, only to find later that much of their understanding of the patient is inaccurate. The patient’s memory problems will also interfere with recall of things that the clinician may tell the patient. <span id="ITerm13">Dementia</span> also often affects people’s interpersonal functioning. The patient may be less inhibited from saying offensive statements or may cross certain social boundaries, such as asking about the clinician’s personal life or commenting on their physical features. Fortunately, clinicians should be accustomed to dealing with patients with deficient interpersonal skills and should understand that these may be behavioral manifestations of underlying brain damage.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Sometimes patients may not have cognitive problems of their own, but they may be caregivers for someone with a neurocognitive disorder. In this case, the patient may not be in need of evaluation or treatment for cognitive problems per se, but they may be significantly affected by someone else’s cognitive disability. In this situation, the person who has the cognitive problems should be evaluated and treated, and the clinician should evaluate how the cognitive problems play a role in the patient’s presenting problems. Caring for someone with a cognitive disability can significantly and negatively impact a patient’s mental health (Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>), and the burden of this may be a major focus of treatment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Many neuropsychologists come in contact with patients who have misconceptions of the nature of <span id="ITerm14">dementia</span> stemming from interactions with other medical professionals. This may result from inaccurate information being provided by other clinicians, or from the patient misunderstanding what has been told to them. For example, one patient reported that she was told that “You don’t have <span id="ITerm15">Alzheimer’s disease</span>, but you have age-related dementia.” Those with current knowledge of neurocognitive disorders know that “age-related dementia” is a poor choice of terms, but that one cause of dementia that increases in prevalence with advanced age is Alzheimer’s disease. Patients very frequently ask for clarification on the terms “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s disease,” have typically not heard the term “neurocognitive disorder,” and usually appreciate explanation of these terms. Patients who need education about these terms should be given it by a clinician who is familiar with this area, especially since our knowledge of the causes of neurocognitive disorders is changing rapidly.</p></section>

When referrals are made to a neuropsychologist, certain information should be included in order to lead to a successful arrival at an answer to the question posed by the referring provider. Any time a referral is made to a neuropsychologist, the referring provider should provide a description of the cognitive problems the patient is thought to be experiencing (for example, memory problems, getting lost while driving, difficulty comprehending instructions, etc.). Some examples of useful referral questions are: “75-year-old woman with memory concerns”; “patient was in car accident 3 years ago and has had trouble working since then; please evaluate if he has cognitive impairment from a head injury.”</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading">Part 2: Clinical Neuropsychological Interviewing</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Introduction</h3><p class="Para" id="Par18">We will now turn to the second part of this chapter, which is an introduction to the complicated and nuanced process of conducting a neuropsychological assessment interview. This is a skill which begins with readings such as this but can only be learned through observation of skilled interviewers and the experience of performing multiple interviews. Readers are referred to works by other authors (Donders, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>; Lezak et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>; Strauss et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Suchy &amp; Miller, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>) that also serve as excellent introductions to neuropsychological interviewing.</p><div class="Para" id="Par19">There are three main sources of information in a <span id="ITerm16">neuropsychological assessment</span>: history, behavioral observations, and test data. The clinical interview provides two of these sources of information, so it is very important to neuropsychological assessment. Neuropsychological testing is only conducted to test hypotheses that are generated before and during the interview. The history and behavioral observations gathered in the interview, and the test data, are combined by the neuropsychologist and used to arrive at a diagnosis and formulation of the patient’s problems. This information is then connected to two factors: (1) to anatomical regions of the brain, or neuropathological processes, which are likely to be involved in the patient’s difficulties and (2) to external daily living ramifications and recommendations. This model is depicted in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">5.2</a></span>.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_5_Chapter/106097_6_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png" style="width:34.4em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 5.2</span><p class="SimplePara">Model of neuropsychological assessment</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par20">There are many different styles of interviewing; some clinicians vary greatly in their styles from one patient to the next, whereas others use the same approach with every patient. Some clinicians use the interview simply to query the patient’s responses on a form they have already completed. One approach is to send a detailed history form to the patient ahead of the appointment, along with a letter reminding them of the appointment and explaining what to expect in the evaluation. When the patient comes to the appointment, the interview consists of a discussion of the reason for referral, current symptoms, and then clarifying information that they provided on the form. This method has several advantages: (1) The patient can look up phone numbers, dates, and other specifics from their medical history without having to remember them during the appointment. The form also prompts them to bring in any past neuropsychological assessment reports and copies of other important records. (2) If the patient completes the form as desired, it can save considerable time on the day of the interview. (3) The form can be completed by a caregiver who may not be able to accompany the patient to the appointment. However, many patients neglect to complete the history form ahead of time, and thus no time is saved. Also, some content areas (current mental health, description of current cognitive symptoms) are best addressed during an in-person interview. As such, these areas would not be covered on this history form.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Reason for Referral</h3><p class="Para" id="Par21">One of the key components, and overall goals, of all neuropsychological interviews is clarifying the reason for referral. The reason for referral generally falls into one of two categories: (1) evaluate the extent, if at all, of cognitive change related to a known neurological condition such as a stroke, head injury, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, or a multitude of other conditions that affect cognitive functioning or (2) evaluate whether a cognitive disorder is present and, if so, what condition is most likely causing it. This differs from the first category in that the patient or referring professional does not know if a medical problem is present or not.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">It can be surprisingly difficult to establish the reason for referral. Referring professionals may not express exactly what information they wish to obtain. They may not point out important information, such as the patient appearing in court in several weeks to have a guardian put in place. They may not supply information that they already know which would be useful to the neuropsychologist. For example, a case manager may refer a 48-year-old woman for evaluation of possible cognitive decline, without mentioning a history of intellectual disability or brain tumor. Patients may have no knowledge of the purpose of the evaluation, other than “My doctor/lawyer sent me here.” If the patient is impaired and without a caregiver present at the evaluation, they may not be able to surmise why they were sent to the evaluation. In cases such as this, the clinician must attempt to infer what the referral question may be.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">It is best to clarify the reason for referral before the patient even comes to the appointment. This can be completed in a 5- or 10-min conversation with the referring professional ahead of time and can prevent a great deal of confusion on the day of the evaluation. Preparatory work like this ahead of time should also be done to possibly decrease the amount of time the patient needs to spend in the evaluation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">In a neuropsychological interview, the clinician should arrive at the reason for referral while also having the goal of evaluating what we know needs to be evaluated. That is, if we know certain factors should be evaluated in the context of a given reason for referral, we should evaluate those factors even if not specifically requested. For example, patients referred for <span id="ITerm17">dementia</span> evaluations should also be screened for depressive symptoms, even though patients or referring providers may not request this. If a patient is reporting difficulties at work since a TBI, we should evaluate his or her work history before the TBI to assess if there truly has been a change. In other words, we should not just evaluate what the patient or referring provider wants to have evaluated. When we go to see a physician, we hope and assume that the physician evaluates things we have not thought of, with the goal of best practice for us.</p><div class="Para" id="Par25">The clinician will be able to deduce the patient’s understanding of what occurs in a neuropsychological evaluation after asking about the reason for referral. Patients typically have incomplete knowledge of what occurs in a neuropsychological evaluation, and often they have no knowledge at all. They may think they are going to have blood drawn, or they may think they are about to have an MRI scan. This should be clarified at the start of the evaluation. Much education can be provided in a one-page form letter sent to patients ahead of time. An example of such a letter is presented in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">5.3</a></span>. Anyone can appreciate the value of knowing what a medical procedure will involve ahead of time. Before testing, they also need to be informed that they will be asked to perform activities that they likely will be unable to complete successfully. For example, they may feel very frustrated at their inability to learn all 16 words on a list-learning task, unless they know ahead of time that hardly anyone is able to do that. Neuropsychological evaluations can be likened to a vision exam, in which almost no one can read the smallest letters shown to them, and it is completely normal if one cannot read the smallest letters. The goal of the vision exam is not to make one feel incompetent but to arrive at proper accommodations for the patient. Clinical neuropsychology is very similar in this regard.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig3"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO3"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_5_Chapter/106097_6_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png" style="width:34.48em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 5.3</span><p class="SimplePara">Sample letter to send to patients ahead of evaluation date</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par26">Once the reason for referral is established, the clinician can move into asking questions most pertinent to the referral question. A useful exercise for clinicians to undergo can be to ask oneself “If I only had ten minutes to do the interview, what information would I want to get?” This can force oneself to prioritize the most important areas to cover. This often comes down to obtaining a history of the current problem at the expense of more distal information.</p></section>

Some examples of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) which can be impacted by cognitive problems include one’s ability to manage finances, manage medications, drive a car or travel independently, shop for groceries, and prepare meals. Assessment of <span id="ITerm18">daily functioning</span> assists in arriving at a diagnosis. For example, if the patient reports that she often forgets conversations with co-workers and it is interfering with her job, this may be a classic symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, the determination of whether a neurocognitive disorder is major or mild rests on whether the patient depends on others for completion of IADLs.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec11"><h4 class="Heading">Medical History</h4><p class="Para" id="Par29">One important area to cover is the patient’s medical history. Here, the interview in a sense serves as a substitute for having actual medical records. If the clinician can obtain medical records ahead of time, then these should be reviewed in detail to obtain a solid understanding of the patient’s medical <span id="ITerm19">conditions</span>. If the clinician can do this ahead of time, it will decrease the amount of time spent discussing medical history in the interview. Unfortunately, in some settings, the clinician cannot obtain these records until the patient arrives at the clinic and signs release of information forms, which are then sent to medical clinics. Medical facilities vary in their responsiveness to requests for records, so a clinician may never be sure that they will be able to obtain these records. This means that the clinician must ask the patient or caregiver for their description of the medical history.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">Medical records often provide information that was inaccurately reported by the patient. For example, a patient reported that after having a stroke, she was unconscious for 3 days. A review of medical records found her to be alert at the time of the stroke, with no mention of any loss of consciousness in the following days. The patient was unlikely to be lying; rather, she probably simply had a poor memory of the event or misunderstood the question asked of her. Another way medical records make a valuable contribution is that they offer documentation of when memory problems began. Patients and their caregivers often have poor recollection of when memory problems began, whereas clinicians can often find mention of memory problems in medical chart <span id="ITerm20">notes</span>. For example, notes from years ago may say something like “patient reports increasing memory problems, and word-finding difficulties are present during the interview.” Information such as this can help the neuropsychologist establish a diagnosis and prognosis for the patient.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">If possible, the clinician should strive to obtain lab results. High white blood cell counts can imply an infection of some sort, which can lead to delirium. A high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) count can imply an underactive thyroid gland, which can reduce cognitive functioning. Other important labs to note are vitamins B<sub>1</sub> (thiamine) and B<sub>12</sub>. Patients typically are unaware of these lab values, or that they have even been drawn, so clinicians must obtain these values from medical charts.</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Other medical <span id="ITerm21">conditions</span> that can impact cognition include a known history of stroke, brain tumors, and recent surgeries. Surgeries in older adults can disrupt blood supply in the brain or can trigger a delirium that can last for days afterward, leading to cognitive deficits. When interviewing a patient, an attempt should be made to see if the onset of cognitive problems is related to parts of their medical history. For example, the patient may have started to experience cognitive problems soon after a fall. This would suggest that the patient may have experienced a traumatic brain injury that has caused cognitive changes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">A list of current medications should also be obtained from the patient. This can be facilitated by having the patient bring a list of all their medications to the appointment or viewing a list on a recent medical document (though these can certainly be inaccurate!). Tricyclic antidepressants, sedative/hypnotic medications such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, anticholinergic drugs, antiepileptic drugs (particularly first-generation medications), proton pump inhibitors (used for reducing stomach acid), and sedating antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) all are medications that can negatively impact cognitive functioning (Crowe, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>; Houston &amp; Bondi, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec12"><h4 class="Heading">Mental Health</h4><p class="Para" id="Par34">Every psychologist, including neuropsychologists, has the specialized training and responsibility to evaluate patients’ current mental health. Again, prior records should be reviewed if possible. Whether or not the patient’s prior history is known, the clinician can simply <span id="ITerm22">ask</span> “how has your mood been lately?” One can also ask “Do you still enjoy activities that you’ve enjoyed before?” These two questions assess two main symptoms of major depressive disorder. Questions about anxiety and symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations and delusions) should also be asked. Interviewing about mental health problems is covered in other chapters of this book. All patients should also be asked if they have ever seen a neuropsychologist before. If they have, those assessment results are extremely valuable in serving as a baseline to compare to current test results.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec13"><h4 class="Heading">Substance Use</h4><div class="Para" id="Par35"><span id="ITerm23">Substance use</span> is another area every psychologist should have some expertise assessing. A helpful way to begin this line of questioning is to ask “How much alcohol do you drink?” This can make the patient less defensive, with the goal of obtaining as accurate an answer as possible. If the clinician instead asks “do you drink any alcohol?”, the patient may simply respond “no” in order to avoid discussing this area, and the clinician will neglect to obtain important information. In this area, the clinician should assess the classic variables of frequency, duration, and intensity. The clinician should find out how often the patient has an alcoholic drink, how many drinks are taken at a given time, and how long they have kept this pattern. Clinicians should inquire as to whether there were times in the past when the patient used alcohol excessively. Clinicians also should not assume that people drink less alcohol as they <span id="ITerm24">age</span>. On the contrary, alcohol use disorders are a problem in older adults as well and are more of a problem because of its contribution to disabling conditions and the slower recovery from them (Woodhead, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). Current alcohol use problems can lead to symptoms of dementia that may resolve with a substantial decrease in alcohol use. Lifelong unhealthy alcohol use unfortunately can lead to a form of dementia, often called Korsakoff’s syndrome or alcohol-related <span id="ITerm25">dementia</span>, and chronic heavy alcohol use can lead to lifelong cognitive deficits. Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3">5.3</a></span> shows the US Department of Health and Human Services (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>) definition of heavy alcohol use to assist the clinician’s understanding of their patient’s responses relating to the level of one’s alcohol use.<div class="Table" id="Tab3"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 5.3</span><p class="SimplePara">Definition of heavy and moderate alcohol use</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Gender</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Heavy alcohol use</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Moderate alcohol use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Men</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">5 or more drinks in a day or 15+ in a week</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Limiting use to 2 drinks a day or less</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Women</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">4 or more drinks in a day or 8+ in a week</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Limiting use to 1 drink a day or less</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Men and women</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Binge drinking 5 or more days in the past month</p></td><td style="text-align: left;"> </td></tr></tbody></table><div class="TableFooter"><p class="SimplePara"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Note</em>: Defined by US Department of Health and Human Services (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>)</p></div></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par36"><span id="ITerm26">Marijuana</span> is another commonly-used substance that affects cognitive functioning. Thus, clinicians are recommended to be direct in their approach to questioning cannabis use. It is imperative that the clinician assess the current use of cannabis due to the negative impact of acute cannabis use (typically a few hours after use) on learning and memory, psychomotor abilities, attention, and working memory (Crane &amp; Wade, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). If a patient reports that they used cannabis on the day of the evaluation, their use would affect their cognitive performance. Research also posits that cognitive functioning may be affected for several days to 2 weeks after use (Dellazizzo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). However, at this time, clear evidence for long-term persistent cognitive difficulties (several days to weeks following use) has not been substantiated; therefore, the clinician may be able to schedule the testing portion of the evaluation by scheduling testing for a week or two later with the patient’s temporary abstinence of cannabis use prior to the testing appointment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">Clinicians should obtain a history of use of other substances such as cocaine, methamphetamines, LSD, and heroin, as well as misuse of prescription medications such as opioid pain medications. While the direct effects of these substances on the brain are less clear, a lifestyle marked by heavy use of these substances or addiction to them can have detrimental effects on brain functioning. Also note that younger cohorts are bringing higher rates of use of illicit drugs into later life (Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec14"><h4 class="Heading">Developmental History</h4><p class="Para" id="Par38">The patient’s <span id="ITerm27">developmental history</span> should be assessed, and this is more important the younger the patient. Early childhood risk factors, including problems at birth and childhood diseases, should be evaluated. Any deviation from normal development should be noted. Especially important for neuropsychological assessment, the clinician should obtain some details about the patient’s <span id="ITerm28">schooling</span>. The quality and quantity of education should be assessed, and any difficulty in particular subjects or any history of special education should be noted. The quantity and quality of education will determine the population to whom the patient is compared when evaluating their neuropsychological test data. Thus, this piece of information, along with the patient’s age, is critical and must be a piece of information gathered from every single neuropsychological assessment patient. The clinician can inquire into this topic by asking “how far did you go in school?” It is important that the clinician converts this into a number of years of education. Neuropsychological tests are normed by years of education, not degrees completed. Thus, if a patient finished high school, this is coded as 12 years of education. If they left high school sometime during their senior year, that is coded as completing 11 years of education. The key is how many full years the patient completed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The quality of education provided to the patient should also be assessed. Twelve years of education for someone from an impoverished environment is not equivalent to 12 years of education from a more enriched <span id="ITerm29">environment</span>. This assessment of quality of education is important because neuropsychologists must compare a patient’s test performance to performance by people of similar backgrounds. If a patient with less education is compared to a population of the same age with more education, the patient may be misdiagnosed as impaired when in fact they have no impairment.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec15"><h4 class="Heading">Occupational History</h4><p class="Para" id="Par40"><span id="ITerm30">Occupational history</span> should also be assessed in all patients for several reasons. This provides the clinician a sense of the baseline functioning of the individual to serve as a comparison for current functioning. Patients who have a history of short durations at any job and who are now seeking disability compensation may have personality characteristics that interfere with their ability to stay in a job for very long, and they may be seeking a way to reduce their need for employment. Also, a description of the patient’s occupation and how their cognitive problems have manifested at work can be elucidating for the clinician in arriving at diagnostic hypotheses.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec16"><h4 class="Heading">Legal History</h4><p class="Para" id="Par41"><span id="ITerm31">Legal history</span> should be assessed, especially for patients currently involved in the legal system, to determine if there is any benefit the patient may experience from being found to have cognitive impairment. Also, the clinician should know if there is a strong probability that the assessment findings will be presented in court, and if there is a chance that the clinician will have to testify. Every report should be written as if there is a chance it will appear in court.</p></section>
</section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec17"><h3 class="Heading">The Interview Process</h3><p class="Para" id="Par42">It cannot be overstated that one important purpose of the interview is to develop rapport with the patient. Rapport serves as the foundation upon which all clinical work is completed (also see Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="106097_6_En_1_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">1</span></a></span>). If the clinician does not have rapport with the patient, then the interview may be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary information. Fortunately, most psychologists are well-skilled in establishing rapport with patients. Some things should be done at the start with a patient in order to establish rapport, and the first meeting with the patient is critical in this regard. Patients should be greeted with a smile and welcomed to the clinic. They should know that their comfort is a priority; for example, they should be informed where the restroom is, and offered a drink of water. Clinicians may wish to keep snacks on hand so patients do not feel hungry. Some clinics offer coffee and tea to patients, but other clinics avoid this in order to set firmer boundaries with patients. Efforts should be made to have frequent eye contact with the patient, and it can be helpful to share a laugh at least once. It can be helpful to clinicians to find something they have in common with a patient and to point that out to the patient. This can be a place in common where they have both lived (without discussing where the clinician currently lives), a favorite pastime, favorite restaurant, favorite sports team, or other commonality that can be discussed without crossing professional boundaries. Even though brief, this time spent leads to development of rapport, which is the basis of all clinical work.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">Neuropsychologists typically use a hypothesis-testing approach when conducting an interview, and during the entire evaluation and report write-up. That is, as the patient begins to report information, the clinician should generate hypotheses to explain the patient’s difficulties. These hypotheses should be tested and either refuted or confirmed. Neuropsychologists collect all the background information, discussed above, to test hypotheses. It is also important that clinicians do not simply seek information that confirms their hypotheses. Clinicians should also seek information that would refute their hypotheses. For example, if the clinician thinks Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of the patient’s problems, the clinician should also seek evidence for other causes of cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium, a TBI, or problematic alcohol or drug use.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">Neuropsychologists typically start the interview with general, open-ended questions (e.g., “so what brings you here today?) and gradually move toward specific questions (Donders, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). This method allows the examiner to observe how the patient reacts to ambiguous stimuli and how the patient structures an unclear situation. Valuable behavioral observations can be made, such as the patient’s ability to find words when communicating freely, their ability to stay on topic, ability to respond to your needs, etc. This also gives the patient the opportunity to express certain needs, problems, or concerns that are most important to them (e.g., an older adult saying “My daughter is trying to put me in a home” or “My memory is shot and I just know I’ve got Alzheimer’s disease,” or a younger adult saying “I really want to be able to go back to work” vs. “I am unable to work and I’m trying to get disability compensation”). This gives the examiner valuable insight into the patient’s thought processes. As the interview proceeds, the clinician can probe for details into relevant areas and ask about areas that have not been covered.</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">It is important to be flexible and responsive to the patient’s wishes for the order in which information is covered. If the patient brings up a topic that the clinician planned to address later, the clinician may wish to let the patient discuss the topic right then, instead of asking the patient to wait until later to discuss it. For example, substance use may be typically covered in the middle of an interview, but if the patient says something like “my wife thinks my memory problems are worse when I’m drinking a lot,” then the clinician may wish to take advantage of that open door and discuss substance use at that time rather than waiting until later. Similarly, if the patient says “I have a family history of <span id="ITerm32">Alzheimer’s disease,</span>” then the clinician may wish to discuss family history of neurological problems at that time rather than re-visiting the topic later.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Along the same lines, the patient may move into a different topic area before the clinician feels finished with the first topic. Here the clinician must decide if it will harm rapport if the clinician asks the patient to come back to the first topic. For example, the patient may say something like “it could be that these problems are related to the time I was knocked out in a fight, but I think that the stale air in my building is interfering with my work. Let me tell you about the building where I work…” At some level, the clinician may wish to have the patient direct the interview, especially for the goal of establishing rapport, but this need must be balanced with the need for the clinician to maintain control and obtain critical information to help the patient.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Some clinicians prefer to interview the patient without having any caregivers in the room, whereas others interview the patient and caregiver simultaneously. It is certainly important to get information from both parties, but each method has its strengths and weaknesses. If the patient is interviewed alone, it is possible that their cognitive impairments or motivations will lead them to report information that is inaccurate, and the clinician may not realize this. This can be ameliorated by interviewing a caregiver at a different time and checking for accuracy. Sometimes, for reasons of practicality, the patient and caregiver are interviewed together. Donders (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) points out that in this case, care must be taken to allow the patient to answer questions independently without being interrupted by the caregiver. The clinician must also show that the patient’s opinions are valued as much as, if not more than, those of the caregiver. Many clinicians make the mistake of speaking primarily to the caregiver, seeming to ignore the patient in the room. This practice, which can be disrespectful to the patient, can lead the patient to feel unimportant or untrustworthy and thus interfere with rapport. On the other hand, the patient may defer to their caregiver and make little effort to provide their own answer. Here, the clinician should also make efforts to encourage the patient to provide their own opinion on things.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">The clinician must strike a balance between guiding the interview to include enough relevant detail, while also maintaining rapport with the patient. This can be challenging when patients’ answers to questions go on tangents about information that is not relevant to the evaluation. For example, a patient may give extreme detail about the job they held 20 years ago, or a patient may complain excessively about the healthcare system. The clinician must be able to interrupt in a polite fashion to move the patient toward providing information that will be more helpful for the evaluation (and thus, the patient’s needs). This can be done by gently interrupting and saying something like “I’d like to hear more about that if we have time later, but right now I wanted to ask you about something else” (and then, before allowing the patient to comment, moving on to the next question). Interrupting the patient can seem intimidating to less-experienced clinicians, but they must remember that the interruption is being done for the patient’s best interests. If a loquacious patient were permitted to talk freely about everything they desired, the evaluation may never be completed and the patient will not be served. Sometimes the very nature of the disorder the patient has (e.g., dementia) makes the patient more prone to such tangential conversation, and more prone to anger if interrupted by the examiner. The examiner must establish adequate rapport to guide the interview in this way. Sometimes it may help to warn the patient at the outset that “we have a lot to cover in a small amount of time, so I may have to interrupt you to make sure you’re able to leave on time. I apologize ahead of time if I have to do this.”</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">On the other hand, rather than rambling, some patients may not provide sufficient information to answer the clinician’s questions and may be resistant to providing more detail. For example, a victim of an assault or other traumatic event may prefer to avoid discussing the nature of the event that caused a head injury, and the clinician must decide whether it is worth pressing for more information at the expense of possibly sacrificing rapport. Most of the time in neuropsychological assessment, rapport with the patient is a higher priority than obtaining all the information desired in an interview. Rapport is necessary to obtain accurate test data. Background information can always be obtained from another source or at a later time.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec18"><h3 class="Heading">Considerations When Using Interpreters for Interviews</h3><p class="Para" id="Par50">With regard to neuropsychological assessment, the ethical standards of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) assert the importance of providing services to the patient in a language consistent with the patient’s preference and reported language proficiency. Using a language that the patient understands allows the patient to be able to make an informed decision about consenting to the assessment. Best practice consists of using an interpreter that is accredited and an interpreter that can come to the evaluation in-person versus via telephone or video services (Fujii et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). On the day of the interview, the patient must give consent to using an interpreter for the assessment and confirm that they understand the interpreter that is present. The clinician then prepares with the interpreter first. Factors of consideration that are emphasized in this pre-interview discussion include, but are not limited to, reviewing and/or defining terms, reviewing the importance of relaying as exact as possible translations of the patient’s responses back to the clinician, as well as informing the interpreter that patients may have difficulty with communication. At the start of the interview, time should be spent preparing the patient for what to expect when using an interpreter in an interview. The clinician will benefit from speaking in short clear sentences and with a slower rate of speech. At times, repetition or re-explanation of questions or words will assist with the patient’s understanding of questions presented. At the end of the interview, the clinician should also provide an overall summary of the patient’s responses to allow an opportunity for the clinician to ensure that they understood the patient. Following the interview, discussion with the interpreter one-on-one is again recommended for review of the patient’s responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Importantly, other aspects of a patient’s culture need to be attended to in addition to the patient’s language proficiency. A helpful acronym has been developed and suggested by Fujii (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>) to aid in this process: ECLECTIC. The components of the acronym ECLECTIC include Education, Culture (including acculturation), Language, Economics, Communication style, factors related to a Testing situation, conceptualization of Intelligence, and Context of immigration. Further reading on these topics is recommended (Fujii, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">Two common referral questions are the evaluation of <span id="ITerm33">traumatic brain injuries</span> and the evaluation of possible dementia. Interviews focused on these referral questions will be discussed next.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec19"><h3 class="Heading">Traumatic Brain Injuries</h3><p class="Para" id="Par53">The evaluation of <span id="ITerm34">traumatic brain injuries (TBIs)</span> in an outpatient setting has at least three goals: (1) to reconstruct a history of the event, (2) to evaluate the effects of the injury on cognition and behavior, and (3) to arrive at recommendations for the patient and their family and/or other care providers. Reconstructing a history of the event includes gauging the severity of the event, because the severity of the event plays a large role in the outcome for the patient’s life. As discussed earlier, severity of TBI is classified using specific criteria noted in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">5.1</a></span> and can be established in several ways. One measure used to assess severity of head injury is the Glasgow Coma Scale (Teasdale &amp; Jennett, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a></span>). The Glasgow Coma Scale is a measure of the motor, verbal, and eye-opening response of a person who has just sustained an injury to the head, and it is often assessed by emergency personnel on the scene or upon arrival of a person at the hospital. Therefore, the Glasgow Coma Scale can often be obtained from medical records. Another criterion used in defining the severity of TBI is if the patient has no memory of events following the injury, known as posttraumatic amnesia. If the patient lacks memory for events after the injury, especially for more than 24 h afterward, this injury would be classified as a moderate or severe TBI. Importantly, the patient’s actual memory of the event must be distinguished from what the patient has been told about the event. By the time the patient sees the neuropsychologist (possibly months or years after the event), the patient may have learned a great deal about what happened in the injury. They may confuse this knowledge of the event with actual memory of the event, and the clinician must take great care to differentiate between the two. This can be helped by the clinician asking the patient about the first thing they recall following the injury.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Another criterion used in defining the severity of <span id="ITerm35">TBI</span> is the presence and length of loss of consciousness. The majority of TBIs are mild, with loss of consciousness less than 30 min or solely an experience of altered consciousness (e.g., feeling confused and dazed), and usually do not lead to permanent deficits. Of note, this does not extend to those diagnosed with mild <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">complicated</em> traumatic brain injury, which is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury with abnormal findings observed on neuroimaging following the injury. Recovery from a mild TBI (uncomplicated), which is used interchangeably with “concussion,” typically occurs within a few hours to days following the injury with only a few experiencing cognitive symptoms 3 months post-injury (McAllister, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Thus, when patients present with a history of concussion, it is likely that they have cognitively recovered from the injury depending on how much time has passed since the event. If the patient continues to experience persistent cognitive difficulties following a concussion, these difficulties are likely related to interference from other factors (e.g., psychological, somatic, substance use), and a neuropsychological evaluation can assist with identification of these other variables that may be impacting a patient’s daily functioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">However, if patients have lost consciousness for longer than 30 min, their head injury would be more severe with potential lingering deficits. Unlike the generally fast recovery course from a concussion, a patient recovering from a moderate to severe <span id="ITerm36">TBI</span> may take 1 year to show the most cognitive improvement after the injury, with most of the recovery taking place within 2 years (King et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Any further improvement is often modest in comparison and variable by patient. Even with marked cognitive improvement in the first 2 years post-injury following a moderate to severe TBI, a patient may never return to their cognitive baseline prior to the injury. Therefore, patients with moderate-to-severe TBIs may have persisting cognitive deficits that impact their ability to live independently or return to work.</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">Along with establishing the severity of the brain injury, another priority of the clinical interview for a patient with <span id="ITerm37">TBI</span> is to re-construct the history of the event. The neuropsychologist performs this through a combination of reviewing medical records of the event, interviewing the patient, and interviewing caregivers. Additionally, the neuropsychologist must learn the nature of the injury and the location of damage in order to assess what cognitive abilities may be affected by the injury. Head injuries can be divided into two types: open (or “penetrating”) head injuries, in which a foreign object penetrates the brain through the skull, and closed head injuries, in which the skull remains largely intact, and no foreign object enters the brain. These two types of head injuries are associated with certain neuropathological processes, and closed head injuries are associated with better outcomes than open head injuries. The neuropsychologist must also know if certain parts of the brain were affected more than other parts, in order to assess what cognitive abilities may have been affected. For example, if the left hemisphere were damaged in an injury, the neuropsychologist would know that a detailed assessment of language is in order. If the left hemisphere was largely unscathed in the injury, the neuropsychologist would need to spend less of the patient’s time evaluating language abilities. Different locations in the brain correspond to different cognitive abilities, and the neuropsychologist’s knowledge of the patient’s specific injury should be combined with knowledge of neuroanatomy to surmise what cognitive abilities may have been affected and thus which should be evaluated.</p><p class="Para" id="Par57">Another large area to consider in the interview with a person with TBI is the changes that have occurred in functioning since the injury event. It is important to compare one’s functioning after the injury event to their functioning before the event. Oftentimes, the clinician will find that problems that have been present since the injury were actually present before the injury and thus are likely not to be an effect of the injury. For example, a patient may have difficulty maintaining employment since an injury, but this may represent baseline functioning. Additional standard components of any diagnostic interview when assessing patients with <span id="ITerm38">TBI</span> are medical history, occupational or academic functioning, substance use, psychiatric functioning, social functioning, etc. The clinician should assess for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">changes</em> in these domains. Hence, clinicians should inquire how these areas were before the injury in addition to how they have been since the injury. Lastly, attention should also be given to potential treatments provided to the patient since the time of injury (e.g., rehabilitation services, medications, etc.).</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">This was an introduction to conducting an interview with patients with a history of TBI. <span id="ITerm39">TBIs</span> are similar to other clinical situations in which the patient has a known history of something that can cause brain damage. Other situations like this are a history of stroke, Parkinson’s disease, brain tumors (adult and pediatric), and pediatric problems such as genetic malformations or fetal alcohol syndrome. With these conditions, the clinician is charged with evaluating the effects of this known condition on cognitive and behavioral functioning. Common elements to the interview for these conditions are that the clinician must assess functioning both before and after the neurological event (with the exception, of course, of problems present since birth), and that the clinician should seek information both from the patient and collateral informants.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec20"><h3 class="Heading">Dementia/Neurocognitive Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par59">The discussion will now turn to evaluation of problems in which a neurological condition is only suspected, rather than known. In these situations, a neurological condition may or may not be present. The neuropsychologist first must determine whether cognitive dysfunction is present. If it is present, only then does the neuropsychologist need to link the current problems to underlying brain <span id="ITerm40">dysfunction</span>. The most common example of this situation is the evaluation of suspected dementia. Another example is the evaluation of suspected neurodevelopmental disorders in children. For neurodevelopmental disorders, it may be impossible to arrive at an etiology of deficits, but the patient can still be helped by the evaluation. Our understanding of neurocognitive disorders, however, is advanced enough that clinicians can usually establish with reasonable certainty an underlying cause of cognitive deficits.</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">Interviews should be conducted with both the patient and a collateral source of information. However, when the patient is clearly cognitively impaired, or uncooperative, the neuropsychologist can obtain this information solely from the caregiver. Either way, the areas of information discussed below should be obtained from both sources to the extent possible.</p><p class="Para" id="Par61">Interviews with patients suspected of having dementia should start with assessing the patient’s knowledge of the reason for referral, as outlined before. The interview should also include discussion of specific cognitive difficulties the patient or their caregiver has noticed. This should start by asking the patient what sort of problems they have been experiencing. Clinicians should probe for examples of cognitive difficulties, which can be very informative. The caregiver may provide a response such as “well, for example, yesterday he asked me five times if I’ve paid the electric bill.” If the caregiver is unable to explain what difficulties the patient is having, or to generate examples, one helpful way to elucidate this information is to ask “Let’s say you had to leave town for a few days. Would you feel safe leaving your loved one at home alone?” This often can lead the caregiver to give specific examples of the patient’s difficulties. For example, this may lead the caregiver to say “No, there’s no way I could leave him home alone. He would forget to turn the stove off and to take his medications!” If the patient or caregiver cannot independently generate examples of everyday problems, then the neuropsychologist can offer examples to see if the patient shows these problems. Examples of everyday manifestations of cognitive problems can be gleaned from the Everyday Cognition Scale by Farias et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>)<span id="ITerm41"/>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">The main cognitive area to inquire into during the evaluation of dementia is memory functioning. The hallmark of <span id="ITerm42">Alzheimer’s disease</span> is impaired ability to remember new information after a time delay. This can manifest in everyday life as forgetting conversations, repeating statements, misplacing items, or forgetting one’s intentions while driving or entering a room. The clinician should inquire with the patient and caregiver whether the patient has displayed symptoms such as these. If the patient seems to have difficulty learning new information (e.g., what the plans are for the upcoming weekend) but seems to retain the small amount that is learned, this could suggest another process such as Parkinson’s disease.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">Another cognitive area to explore is language functioning; for example, how well does the patient understand what is spoken to them? Does the patient have trouble thinking of the right word to say in conversations, or have difficulty speaking in general? If difficulty is reported in these areas, it could be due to a process involving the left frontotemporal area, such as primary progressive aphasia or vascular damage to this area, and may be independent of Alzheimer’s disease. Another area to cover is executive functioning, which is defined in many ways. Some everyday skills that can be categorized as executive functioning include appropriate social behavior (e.g., inhibiting oneself from offensive behaviors), initiating appropriate activity during one’s day (e.g., preparing healthy meals, keeping up with bills), and planning ability (e.g., structuring a day’s errands in an efficient manner, planning a holiday meal). Impairments in these abilities may reflect damage to the frontal lobes, caused by frontotemporal dementia, vascular damage to this area, or advanced stages of <span id="ITerm43">Alzheimer’s disease</span>. For example, one patient with frontotemporal dementia began a new behavior of shoplifting small items like cookies and candy bars, and became hostile to a security guard when caught. Sometimes patients can report that their skills in general are fine but that everything they do takes longer than it used to. This slowness of processing can be extremely disabling and can be frustrating and embarrassing when trying to engage in conversation with others. Slowed processing speed can be due to disorders of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson’s disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, or strokes in specific locations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par64">There are several elements of the history of the presenting problem that should be assessed in patients suspected of having dementia. The history of onset of symptoms is essential information. How long have the problems been present? If they have developed gradually over a year or more, the symptoms may be due to <span id="ITerm44">Alzheimer’s disease (AD)</span>. Sometimes symptoms of AD are present for months or years but not prominent until some crisis occurs. The “crisis” could be a family vacation, death in the family, medical situation, or other situation outside of normal functioning in which the patient was pushed beyond their capabilities. Often, the patient or family cannot pin down a specific time that symptoms began. Vascular dementia, on the other hand, tends to begin with a specific event such as a stroke or myocardial infarction. Patients with vascular dementia tend to have vascular diseases in their medical history, such as hypertension, diabetes, or atrial fibrillation, but these diseases can be present in patients with other types of dementia.</p><div class="Para" id="Par65">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">course</em> of symptoms should also be assessed. Patients with vascular dementia theoretically have a stepwise course of decline, in which they are stable for some time, then decline, then are stable, then decline again. AD, on the other hand, is characterized by a gradual decline. In reality, patients with vascular dementia often do not show a stepwise pattern of decline, and patients with AD often show a steep decline after an abnormal event (e.g., a hospitalization), but the clinician should nonetheless be aware of these possible differences in course. Patients who show variability in symptoms throughout the course of the day may be suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies. Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab4">5.4</a></span> provides a general overview of differences in the onset and course of symptoms with corresponding potential etiologies. It is also important to understand that most cases of dementia have two or more underlying causes (Nichols et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).<div class="Table" id="Tab4"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 5.4</span><p class="SimplePara">Overview of different onset and course of symptoms with corresponding potential etiologies</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Cognitive or behavioral symptoms</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Potential etiology</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Cognitive fluctuations (“comes and goes”)</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Delirium, Lewy bodies</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Gradual or insidious decline</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Stepwise decline</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Vascular disease</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Sudden onset of change</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Vascular disease (i.e., stroke event), traumatic brain injury (TBI), delirium</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Recurrent vivid visual hallucinations</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Lewy bodies</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Early symptoms include personality/behavior change</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Frontotemporal degeneration</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Early symptoms include language changes</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Primary progressive aphasia, possible Alzheimer’s disease</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">REM sleep behavior disruption</p></td><td style="text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">– Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par66">Neuropsychologists are often requested to evaluate whether an older adult is experiencing symptoms of depression or dementia, or both. It is important to know that depression and dementia frequently co-occur, particularly in the early stages of dementia (Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). During the interview, several factors can help to differentiate between depression and dementia. Older adults with depressive symptoms are often aware of memory problems, or even exaggerate problems that may not even be present. Patients with dementia, on the other hand, are often unaware of their cognitive difficulties. Another obvious but important thing to assess is current and past history of depressive symptoms. This can help elucidate whether current depressive symptoms are contributing to cognitive impairment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par67">The clinician should ensure that the interview is ended appropriately. Donders (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) points out that it is often useful to summarize the main concerns noted in the interview, assess for correctness with the patient, and then ask the patient if there are any other questions or concerns the patient would like to add before proceeding with the evaluation. One benefit to this is that the patient may mention something that the clinician may have neglected to inquire into. Clinicians should also expect that there will be questions they forgot to ask, and these questions can be asked later in the evaluation, or even over the phone on a later date.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec21"><h2 class="Heading">Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par68">It should be clear after reading this chapter that the clinical interview is an essential part of the neuropsychological assessment process. It is also a complex set of skills that develops by conducting many interviews over time. Students should seek out opportunities to observe multiple experienced clinicians conducting interviews to develop this skill and to glean aspects of multiple clinicians’ styles of interviewing. This, combined with experience conducting numerous interviews, will enable the clinician to learn this valuable skill.</p></section>
