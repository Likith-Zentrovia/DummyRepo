By coalescing observations from these domains, the MSE paints a picture of the client at a given point in time and helps the clinician form a working hypothesis about a client’s psychiatric diagnosis/es and <span id="ITerm2">functioning</span>. A standardized approach and focused questions allow the <span id="ITerm3">clinician</span> to assess multiple <span id="ITerm4">domains</span>—and ascertain patterns across <span id="ITerm5">domains</span>—to best conceptualize and understand the client. Any indications of abnormality should be reported and described.</p><div class="Para" id="Par3">Consider the following two examples:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par4"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The client was a 69-year-old, Spanish speaking, Hispanic white man who appeared younger than his stated age. He was of average weight and dressed appropriately in tailored slacks and a button-up shirt. Intact grooming and hygiene were noted, as evidenced by neatly trimmed hair and fingernails and a closely clipped beard. He was cooperative with his examiner and translator but responded in a very concise manner to the examiner’s questions without much elaboration. Over the course of the interview, he became more forthcoming and at times tearful. He evidenced an anxious affect, sitting with his hands clenched and often averting eye contact to stare at the floor.</em></p></blockquote></div><div class="Para" id="Par5"><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par6"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A 42-year-old multiracial, nonbinary (pronouns: they/them) person presented 20 minutes late to their appointment, arriving via bus with their adult daughter. A lack of grooming and hygiene was evident. Mx. Jones was disheveled; their clothes appeared unwashed and stained, and their hair appeared unwashed and unbrushed. They left their sunglasses on during the interview and would rise frequently from the chair to walk around the room and mutter incomprehensibly. They had a notable body odor of stale cigarette smoke. Mx. Jones appeared apathetic and evidenced poor insight, responding to the examiner’s questions with phrases such as “I don’t know. She brought my here,” referring to their daughter.</em></p></blockquote></div><p class="Para" id="Par7">Without knowing more about each client’s symptoms or problems, these brief examples begin to illustrate the unique presentations and potential difficulties experienced by each individual. Each vignette raises different clinical hypotheses and suggests different lines of inquiry during the interview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">Although individual observations may be important to consider in isolation, remember that the <span id="ITerm6">MSE</span> is only one component of a comprehensive examination and is most meaningful in the context of a thorough evaluation that includes a psychosocial history, review of psychiatric symptoms, and medical evaluation to inform a diagnosis and initial treatment plan (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">During an <span id="ITerm7">intake interview</span>, the MSE offers the clinician’s initial insights into the client’s functioning and disorder severity compared to individuals from the same population or setting. In a treatment context, these impressions may evolve over time and with ongoing interactions. Progress notes containing comprehensive <span id="ITerm8">MSE</span> snapshots track changes throughout treatment, aiding communication among healthcare providers and documenting therapeutic progress.</p><div class="Para" id="Par10">In this chapter, we review key components of the MSE (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">4.1</a></span>), describe assessment procedures for conducting the evaluation, and remark on unique considerations for representative settings and special populations.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading">Components of the Mental Status Exam</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">General Observations</h3><p class="Para" id="Par11">Within the context of a thorough evaluation, the <span id="ITerm10">MSE</span> offers the clinician a unique opportunity to observe and interpret client behavior and highlight the idiosyncratic characteristics of the person in the room. The general observations of the MSE include a broad range of characteristics that are immediately observable to the clinician. These are described in detail within the MSE to inform our understanding of how the client presents themselves to the world and, reflexively, how they are perceived by others. Features of the client’s appearance and behaviors may fluctuate over the course of the evaluation or remain static—each noteworthy for interpretation. Independently, each of these features, even if unusual or <span id="ITerm11">pathological</span>, may be incidental and unworthy of interpretation; however, the combined effect of multiple observations guides the attentive clinician toward a thorough and accurate conceptualization over time.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Arrival</strong>: The clinician notes the timing of the client’s arrival (e.g., early, on-time, late) and whether they came to the appointment alone or with a family member, friend, or caregiver. Documenting the method of transportation used to get to the appointment (e.g., personal car, bus, bike) can also be useful for interrogating greater system-level barriers that the client faces and for optimizing scheduling and attendance. Late arrivals may be indicative of disorganization or poor planning, may suggest ambivalence about treatment, or could result from a public transportation delay. If the client is accompanied by a family member or other caregiver, this can offer information about the client’s support system and level of independence in daily functioning. Initial interactions with administrative staff can reflect the client’s ability to navigate large, complex healthcare <span id="ITerm12">systems</span> and to engage in social interactions with strangers. Familiarity with the setting and location may imply intact recall of prior or related appointments, whereas difficulties with check-in may imply the novelty of the appointment to the client’s typical routine. Details about the client’s attitude toward the session can be observed and inferred from the client’s behavior in the waiting room or lobby prior to the start of the appointment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par13"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Appearance</strong>: Describing grooming, dress, and other appearance factors (e.g., body size and stature) can provide rich information, including impressions about overall health and well-being, organization, and awareness of environmental and contextual cues, such as weather and formality of the setting. Descriptions of hygiene and grooming may note appearance of skin, hair, teeth, and clothing, as well as the presence of body odor. Use of visual, hearing, or ambulatory aids should be <span id="ITerm13">noted</span>. Clinicians may describe whether the person appears younger or older than, or consistent with, their stated age. Each feature of the client’s physical appearance presents an opportunity for the clinician to engage in client-centered questioning that emphasizes the clinician’s attention to and care for the client, facilitating the development of rapport.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Beyond health, well-being, and overall attention and care to appearance, these factors can provide possible clues about client income and spending habits as well as their adherence to cultural norms and popular trends. Attention to details of appearance aids the clinician in understanding how this client is likely to be perceived by others. Physical evidence of bodily injuries or scars, particularly those that are recent, contributes to the clinician’s impressions about client health and safety. Injuries can serve as possible indicators of self-harm, abuse, neglect, possible substance <span id="ITerm14">misuse</span>, falls, and mobility problems. Notable decline in grooming and hygiene suggests the need to further assess functional impairment. Of note, clinicians should present objective and specific observations in this section using up-to-date language and consider their own biases and cultural assumptions. Judgment of appearance is highly susceptible to culturally shaped ideals. Hair (e.g., locs) and headwear (e.g., Jewish men wearing a kippah or yarmulke, Sikh men and women wearing a turban) are especially related to identity and culture. Although noting body size/stature is common in the MSE, clinicians must take care to avoid anti-fat bias. Clinicians must avoid perpetuating systemic exclusion, structural racism, and implicit bias and use inclusive language when describing individuals (American Psychological Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). For example, rather than writing that a client “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">is unattractive and does not take good care of herself</em>,” a more useful description may observe the client <span id="ITerm15">was</span> “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">disheveled and apparently lacking in grooming and hygiene, presenting to the appointment with stained clothes, food in her teeth, and notable body odor</em>.” It is important to keep in mind that clients typically have the right to access their clinical notes and may read the MSE.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Speech and language</strong>: Clinicians must assess the nature and quality of a client’s spontaneous speech, which may reveal unique aspects of a client’s psychological and cognitive functioning. Speech <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">content</em> reflects underlying thought processes and is analyzed in the below section on Thinking. In contrast, speech <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">quality</em> is evaluated based on rate, tone, volume, and prosody. Speech <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rate</em> indicates response speed (i.e., absent, slow, normal, fast, pressured). Speech <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tone</em> can be static or variable. A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">monotone</em> client has an unchanging vocal expression regardless of emotion or content, while a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">variable</em> tone, within normal limits, reflects culturally typical voice inflection, indicating mood, affect, and emotional connection to the content. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Volume</em> measures the loudness of <span id="ITerm16">speech</span> relative to situational appropriateness. <span id="ITerm17"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hypophonia</em></span>, defined as soft speech often seen in neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease, may result from vocal muscle coordination issues. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Prosody</em> encompasses rhythm and articulation, and it may reflect latency between thoughts. These features collectively indicate language fluency and ease for the client. Other features of speech should also be considered, including the client’s average length of utterance, the syntactical structure, grammatical accuracy, choice of vocabulary, and presence of any regional accents. Such features may imply a level of knowledge and familiarity with the language itself, which would be expected to vary for a native speaker compared to a client for whom English is a second language.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Behavior and psychomotor activity</strong>: Observing client behavior and psychomotor activity during the interview provides insights into symptom presence and frequency. Clinicians should note subtle <span id="ITerm18">abnormalities</span>, such as excessive or absent movement (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">positive and negative symptoms</em>), which may indicate neurological issues or movement disorders. In the absence of such a contribution, such excessive, slowed, or absent movements may indicate psychotic features, substance influence, major depressive disorder, or discomfort, such as anxiety or guardedness. Clients with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">trichotillomania</em> (hair pulling) or similar bodily-focused behaviors may exhibit these patterns to relieve tension or distress. It is crucial to observe any mismatch between a client’s outward state and their expressed thoughts and emotions. Clients may deny psychological distress verbally but exhibit behaviors suggesting underlying distress. Note eye contact, mannerisms, and overall posture during the interview, which reflect the client’s internal state and comfort level with the therapist. Details like pupil size indicate engagement, interest, or potential substance use or psychosis. For example, a depressed client may slouch and avoid eye contact, while a guarded client may cross their arms, and an anxious client may display nervous habits like hair twirling. Each of these behaviors contributes to the clinician’s impression.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17"><span id="ITerm19">Psychomotor activity</span> also encompasses formal assessment of neurological symptoms like gait and motor abnormalities. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with common motor symptoms in various neurological conditions. For instance, Parkinson’s disease often shows resting tremor, stiffness, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bradykinesia</em> (slowness of movement), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">akinesia</em> (reduced voluntary movement), and abnormal gait (short strides with postural abnormalities; Thenganatt &amp; Louis, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>). Huntington’s disease features <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">chorea</em> (full-body jerking movement), while advanced dementias or encephalopathy may cause a wide-based, unsteady, or shuffling (train track) gait. Multiple sclerosis may involve muscle weakness and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">paresthesia</em> (numbness and tingling), and strokes can lead to persistent motor deficits like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">hemiparesis</em> (one-sided weakness). Observation provides insight and signals the use of formal testing to help diagnose and assess severity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Manner of relating and attitude toward the examiner</strong>: The clinician summarizes the client’s relational manner, capturing how they present and express themselves. This observation includes the client’s interpersonal style and perception of the interview setting, providing indicators of their attitude. Receptiveness to treatment is assessed through their overall behavior and responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">Clients’ relational styles vary and can be gleaned from observations of behavior, speech, and content. Assessment includes eye contact, motor behavior, emotional transparency, and compliance. A client’s relational style can range from hostile, aggressive, guarded, cooperative, pleasant, to passive. Different psychiatric disorders are associated with distinct patterns of comportment. For example, the client with schizophrenia may be most likely to regard the clinician with suspicion; the client with borderline personality disorder may fluctuate between excessive admiration for and dissatisfaction with the clinician at different points in time; and the client with depression may be cooperative and compliant, but passive.</p><div class="Para" id="Par20">The following example demonstrates general observations about a new client:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par21"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ms. Martin is a 71-year-old white woman presenting for initial evaluation in the context of persistent symptoms of depression, following her recent diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. She arrived for her appointment on time and was unaccompanied. She ambulated with the assistance of a rolling walker; her gait was slow with shallow steps. She exhibited fluctuating dyskinesia of the head, neck, and trunk throughout the day, which worsened with increasing time since her medication dose. Oral comprehension was intact as evidenced by Ms. Martin’s responses to interview questions. Her spontaneous speech was fluent and prosodic but slowed and hypophonic with mildly decreased articulation. Ms. Martin was friendly and cooperative and remained engaged with the clinician throughout the interview.</em></p></blockquote></div></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Thinking</h3><p class="Para" id="Par22">It can be challenging to accurately assess client thinking, given the internal nature of this domain, which may include the client’s inner dialogue. As a result, much of this information is gleaned through observation of the client throughout the interview. Nonetheless, clinicians must also directly assess the presence of perceptual disturbances (e.g., hallucinations) and risk of harm. Assessment of thought is paramount for detecting and differentiating certain psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Clients without psychopathology, as well as those with otherwise significant psychological problems (e.g., anxiety or depressive disorders), are often able to express themselves in an organized and realistic fashion. Disturbances in thinking should raise suspicion of a psychotic disorder but may also suggest a severe depressive episode, mania, substance use/misuse, or other disorders affecting cognition including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and <span id="ITerm20">autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</span>.</p><div class="Para" id="Par23"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Thought process</strong>: <span id="ITerm21">Thought process</span> (or thought form) is the way a person thinks, as evidenced by how they link ideas and associations. Clinicians assess the logic, relevance, organization, flow, and coherence of thought in response to general questioning throughout the interview. Client responses can be described in myriad ways (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">4.2</a></span> for descriptions and examples of these terms).<div class="Table" id="Tab2"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 4.2</span><p class="SimplePara">Characteristics of thought process and content</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Term</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Definition</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Example</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Circumstantiality</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Responses are overelaborate but are ultimately relevant</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Clinician: “What’s your name?”</p><p class="SimplePara">Client: “Well, sometimes when people ask me, I have to think about whether or not I will answer because some people think it’s an odd name even though I don’t really because my mom gave it to me and I think my grandma helped but it’s as good a name as any in my opinion, but yeah it’s Jim”</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Tangentiality</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Answers to questions are obliquely related to or never finish the original point; topics may be brought to mind by either internal or external stimuli</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Clinician: “What did you do today?”</p><p class="SimplePara">Client: “I really got mad as I was waiting in line at the grocery store.

For example, pressured speech, in which a person’s speaking is accelerated and difficult or impossible to interrupt, is typically associated with extremely rapid thinking manifesting as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">flight of ideas</em>, in which an individual seemingly jumps from one topic to another with fragmented ideas and only superficial associations between them. Consider the following example:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par25"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mr. Washington, a 24-year-old, multiracial, heterosexual man, responded to the clinician’s inquiry about his emergency department visit with the following rapid flight of ideas: “I got here in a cab. A taxicab. The cab was made by Ford. Ford was at one point the largest auto manufacturer in the world. The world has seven-and-a-half billion people in it. All these people are causing climate change. Yuma has been devastated by drought, but wetlands have been reintroduced. I was introduced to a famous movie producer once…”</em></p></blockquote></div><p class="Para" id="Par26">Conversely, a client may exhibit slow or hesitant thinking. Termed <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bradyphrenia</em>, this slowness of thought is characteristic of developmental disabilities such as intellectual developmental disorder, psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and can be a side effect of some antipsychotic medications. The mental fog of severe depression may also produce slowed thought, and some clients with this experience indicate that friends or family members have noticed the problem. Medical conditions can also alter mental status, including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), delirium, and acute substance intoxication. For example, hypoglycemia may present as sudden confusion, and delirium can present with perceptual distortions but also confusion, disorientation, and general fluctuations in consciousness.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">The flow of thought refers to how thoughts are connected and may be described somewhere along the continuum from goal-directed to incoherent or disorganized. Flow of thought also incorporates the continuity of thought, with descriptors such as tangential, circumstantial, evasive, or perseverative. Notable types and examples of these are described in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">4.2</a></span>. These observations complement assessment of the quality of thought.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Clinicians can also remark on the quality of thought process, such as in the case of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">poverty of thought</em>. A client with poverty of thought will respond to questions with the minimum number of words required and offer very little of the spontaneous speech typical of normal thought processes. The clinician will find himself asking more questions than usual because the client offers little elaboration. Asking open-ended questions is an effective way to elicit a flow of spontaneous speech, preventing a simple yes or no answer. Importantly, the clinician must assess whether this type of client is evidencing poverty of thought (a symptom of a psychotic or thought disorder) or presenting as guarded or hostile. A related term is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">alogia</em>, which is a lack of speech caused by impaired thought process. This extreme example of thought poverty is a common negative symptom of schizophrenia.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Some clients may evidence copious amounts of spontaneous speech but communicate very little meaning. Such poverty of content might occur when the client speaks in an overly abstract manner. For example, they might answer a direct question from the clinician with a very indirect response: “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Doctor, the answer to your question relates to what I’ve been saying before. I think we were conversing about this topic and such, and I agree that it is a good question. Of course, this is all dependent on our communication, and I would like to communicate with you, as you very well understand. I would love to talk more about this.</em>” Although the client produced speech, the clinician’s question has not been answered. Importantly, this is not because the client veered away from the topic at hand, such as in the case of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">loose associations</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">tangentiality</em>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Thought content</strong>: <span id="ITerm22">Thought content</span> refers to themes of an individual’s thought. Disturbed thought content typically refers to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">delusions</em>, but may also include ruminations, obsessions, fears or phobias, or symptoms or preoccupations of illness anxiety.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">Delusions are erroneous fixed beliefs, meaning they do not change in light of conflicting evidence, and are not supported by the person’s culture. The content of delusions dictates how they are classified (described) and may include persecutory, referential, somatic, grandiose, religious, or bizarre beliefs. <span id="ITerm23"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Persecutory delusions</em></span>, common in psychiatric populations, involve the belief of being harmed or harassed. Related are paranoid delusions, in which a person is fearful and doubtful of others. In schizophrenia, misinterpretation of social cues can lead to symptoms like paranoid or persecutory delusions. Paranoid delusions include <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">delusions of control</em>—individual believes they are being controlled by an outside force—and <span id="ITerm24"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Capgras syndrome</em></span>, where a loved one is thought to be replaced by an imposter. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Referential delusions</em> (also called delusions of reference) involve believing gestures, comments, or news events are directed specifically at the client. The client’s belief may range from strangers talking about them to TV or radio broadcasters sending them direct special messages. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Somatic delusions</em> entail fixed beliefs about medical illness or poisoning without evidence, distinct from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">illness anxiety disorder</em> (formerly hypochondriasis) which involves preoccupation with illness and worry yet allows for doubt. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Cotard’s syndrome</em><span id="ITerm25"/> is a nihilistic delusion denying the existence of anyone or anything, in which the person may believe they themselves are dead. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Grandiose delusions</em> involve believing in special powers or abilities, often with religious connotations (e.g., client’s belief that they are a prophet, Messiah, or royalty), and can manifest during manic episodes or drug-induced psychosis. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Erotomanic delusions</em> involve the client believing that a higher-status individual is in love with them. Delusions are classified as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">bizarre</em> if they are clearly implausible and not understood within one’s cultural context. For example, some persecutory delusions, such as the government wiretapping the client’s phone, are unlikely but not considered bizarre. Conversely, delusions about alien invasion or mind reading are thought of as bizarre.</p><div class="Para" id="Par32">Questions to assess disturbed thought content, if not evidenced during the rest of the interview, include general questions (“What do you think about when you’re sad [or angry]?” What’s been on your mind lately?”) as well as more specific inquiries regarding obsessions (“Do you have intrusive or repetitive thoughts or ideas?”) or ruminations (“Do you find yourself dwelling on things?”). You can also ask if the client has had thoughts or images that have been difficult to get out of their head, or if they are worried, scared, or frightened about anything. Here we offer an example of disturbed thought content observed in a client:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par33"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mr. Ali is a 57-year-old unhoused man with a psychotic disorder who was hospitalized for complications secondary to a large inguinal hernia. He did not want physicians to operate, as he believed the protrusion and resultant swelling in his scrotum was evidence of special sexual prowess given to him by alien beings. He believed that his surgeon was “jealous” and only wanted to operate to remove the client’s advantage with women.</em></p></blockquote></div><p class="Para" id="Par34"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Suicidal and homicidal ideation</strong>: Assessment of suicidality and homicidality is a unique and essential aspect of client thought content that deserves special attention by the clinician. Such assessment is crucial in every clinical interview as it represents one of the major areas of risk for clients in mental health settings (not to mention clinician liability). It is routinely documented in the MSE, whether present or absent. Clinicians should ascertain the nature of a client’s suicidality, whether it be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">passive ideation</em>, such as a desire to “not wake up,” versus an intention to actively end one’s life (often referred to as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">active ideation</em>). Whether or not a client endorses current suicidality, it is important to assess prior history of suicidal attempts and self-harm. Recent serious attempts, such as those with lethal risk and/or the provision of rapid and effective emergency response, imply greater risk and greater need for focused attention (Jobes, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Common questionnaires can be utilized by clinicians to assess the presence and severity of suicidal ideation. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (Kroenke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a></span>) is commonly administered to assess for the presence of suicidal ideation; item 9 asks about the presence and frequency of thoughts that “life is not worth living, or that you’d be better off dead?”. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) is routinely used to assess the severity of, and changes in, suicidal ideation and behavior. It includes questions that assess the person’s wish to be dead (i.e., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Do you wish you weren’t alive anymore?</em>) and active suicidal thoughts (i.e., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Have you had any thoughts about killing yourself?</em>). Furthermore, clinicians can assess suicidal ideation in conversation using direct and straightforward questioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Homicidal thoughts or intention to assault someone else can be assessed similarly. Clinicians can assess for homicidal intent in conversation by checking in on stressors associated with harm (“How are things going for you? (at home, school, work, etc.”)), identifying thoughts of revenge (“Have you ever had thoughts of hurting/killing someone?”), and intensity and frequency of lethal motivation (“How often do you think about hurting them?”). Clinicians should be aware of, and follow, mandatory reporting guidelines for states in which they are licensed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Perception</strong>: Perceptual <span id="ITerm26">disturbances</span> result from impaired sensory processing, with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">hallucinations</em> (internally generated perceptions) being the most relevant in psychiatric assessments. Clinicians must differentiate hallucinations from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">illusions</em>, which are misattributions of vague external stimuli (e.g., client sees someone else in conversation and assumes that person is talking about them). Assessing the nature and sensory system involved in hallucinations is crucial, as they can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Auditory hallucinations</em> (hearing voices distinct from one’s thoughts) are most common in psychotic disorders. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Command auditory hallucinations</em> involve voices instructing actions (e.g., jump in front of a bus) and warrant evaluation for client compliance. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Visual hallucinations</em> can occur in individuals with psychotic disorders as well as in individuals with delirium, Lewy Body dementia, and Charles Bonnet syndrome, and may indicate neurological involvement (O’Brien et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">Hallucinations in other sensory modalities occur less frequently in psychosis. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Olfactory hallucinations</em>, while secondary in psychosis, are common in temporal lobe epilepsy, brain injury, and migraine (Hsu &amp; Suh, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Gustatory hallucinations</em> are rare and understudied, often accompanying olfactory hallucinations and suggesting neurological dysfunction. Tactile hallucinations, like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">formication</em> (e.g., feeling of bugs crawling on skin), are associated with stimulant use, alcohol withdrawal, Lyme disease, and herpes zoster (shingles).</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Like thought disturbances, hallucinations are internal experiences that must be inferred from what the client reports. The following are example questions to assess for the presence of <span id="ITerm27">hallucinations</span>: “Do you ever see (visual) or hear (auditory) things that no one else can see or hear, such as voices or visions?”; “Have you ever smelled (olfactory), tasted (gustatory), or felt (tactile) things that are not really there?”; “Have you experienced any other strange sensations that others do not seem to experience?”</p><div class="Para" id="Par40">Consider the following example describing perceptual disturbances in a client:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par41"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mr. Kim is a 31-year-old Asian man who reports hearing near-constant voices that command him to kill himself. He hears 3 different voices, all men and unfamiliar. The voices are highly personalized and routinely comment on his thoughts and actions, usually in an abusive and derogatory fashion (i.e., “You’re worthless!”). When he walks across a freeway overpass, one of the voices urgently tells him to jump off, and he has difficulty resisting.</em></p></blockquote></div></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Emotion</h3><p class="Para" id="Par42">Emotional <span id="ITerm28">disturbance</span> is a central feature in many common psychiatric disorders, and thus is an important domain for both observation and inquiry during the clinical interview. The client’s emotional experience may color their speech, physical appearance, and nonverbal behavior throughout the interview, yielding important diagnostic information. Although the overall emotional tone of a client is usually obvious, accurately observing the gradations and subtleties of emotional expression is a skill that develops over time and with client-focused inquiry and use of reflection.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Mood</strong>: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mood</em> is a <span id="ITerm29">sustained</span> emotional experience (over days or weeks), characterized through the client’s persistent and repeated descriptions and behaviors. Mood tends to color the person’s perception of the world, such as in the case of a pessimistic attitude in someone with depressed mood. Although mood is typically a prolonged state, it may be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">labile</em> (easily altered, e.g., as in the case of someone with borderline personality disorder) and can fluctuate between extremes (as in the case of someone with bipolar disorder).</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">The best way to elicit a client’s mood is usually to ask directly with questions like “How do you feel right now?”; “How has your mood been the past few days (or weeks)?”. Indeed, the clinician often uses the client’s own <span id="ITerm30">description</span> of their mood placed in quotation marks in the write-up of the MSE. If the client answers in vague terms, the clinician may need to ask further questions to refine an understanding of the mood. For example, if a client remarks that their mood has been “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Not so great</em>…”, the clinician could follow up by asking, “Can you give that feeling a name?” or “Can you give that feeling an emotional label, like sad, frightened, angry, or so on?”</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Individuals from older cohorts or those less acculturated to Western values of emotional disclosure may have difficulty naming their emotional experience, or may resist clinical terms for their mood, like “depressed.” In such cases, the clinician may consider other variants, describing sadness as feeling “down” or “blue,” and using questions to elicit the enduring mood based on the client’s own words. Of note, individuals with different psychiatric conditions, including some personality disorders, may evidence <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">alexithymia</em>, an inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.</p><div class="Para" id="Par46"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Affect</strong>: <span id="ITerm31"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Affect</em></span> reflects current emotional state, akin to immediate weather, while mood represents a longer-lasting emotional experience, like a season. Affect is more variable and context-dependent than mood. Normally, mood and affect align, but psychiatric disorders can cause discrepancies. Inappropriate affective responses to situations may indicate underlying issues. For example, it would be unexpected and incongruent for a client to laugh while talking about the recent death of a loved one or smiling while describing an abuse history. Such a presentation may suggest anxiety or discomfort disclosing painful emotions or thoughts; at the extreme, such incongruence may occur in individuals with schizophrenia. Affect is described by observed emotional expression, with common adjectives including depressed, anxious, angry, and indifferent. Clinicians should note extremes like elation, which can indicate mania or hypomania. If affect is seemingly normal or unremarkable, more specific terms like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">euthymic</em> or calm may be appropriate. In addition to affect quality, noting fluctuations, range, and intensity is crucial in the MSE. Compared to stable affect, clinicians should observe for labile affect, marked by rapid or abrupt shifts in emotional display. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder may evidence such instability in emotional range. Extreme lability (e.g., going from laughing to sobbing within minutes in the absence of amusement or sadness) may indicate <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pseudobulbar affect</em>, common in individuals with brain injury or other neurological conditions. A broad range of affect involves full and appropriate emotional expression across face, body language, voice tone, and pitch. A restricted range indicates reduced emotional expression. Intensity may be described as normal, blunted, or flat. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Blunted affect</em> shows severe reduction, while <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">flat affect</em> shows virtually no emotional expression. A client with blunted affect may describe the death of a significant other by stating the facts, with little emotional detail, displaying only occasional, mild expressions of sadness. Blunting and flattening of affect may occur in schizophrenia, severe depression, PTSD, Parkinson’s, or ASD. Antipsychotic or antidepressant medication, sedatives, or mood tranquilizer use can also cause secondary blunting. We include an example of affective presentation in the context of a manic episode:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par47"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ms. Patel is a 52-year-old Southeast Asian woman with a history of bipolar I disorder who presents to the hospital emergency department accompanied by her son. When questioned about her mood, she reported extreme happiness and a sense that “I feel high as a kite.” She evidenced expansive and exaggerated affect throughout the interview, presenting as euphoric but alternating with irritability.</em></p></blockquote></div></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Cognition</h3><p class="Para" id="Par48">Assessing a client’s <span id="ITerm32">cognition</span> entails evaluating their thinking ability, or their ability to acquire and utilize information. This may be done either informally (e.g., conversationally) or formally (e.g., using validated assessment instruments). Clinicians in triage settings (e.g., psychiatric emergency department) will not likely have the flexibility, time, or resources to conduct formalized cognitive testing; however, clinicians in other settings might add objective assessment screeners to their practice to inform treatment decisions. In this section, we discuss the observation and assessment of cognitive variables without the use of standardized tests. The aspects of cognition delineated below, as well as the strategies for assessing them, are useful for a variety of settings that require quick evaluations (for additional information about the use of formal neuropsychological assessment, see Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="106097_6_En_5_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par49"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Orientation</strong>: The first and perhaps <span id="ITerm33">easiest</span> aspect of cognition to assess is the client’s orientation to person, place, time, and situation, as well as level of consciousness. For the cognitively normal client, the quick and familiar “alert and oriented x4” classification is a necessary snapshot of client presentation that is meaningful across healthcare disciplines. Common variations of this include clients who may be largely oriented, but without the ability to specify details about time or place, as with those experiencing dementia. Others may report correct orientation to place and time but may falter in their description of a session’s situation or precipitating purpose. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Level of consciousness</em> is typically summarized by a single word, indicating the extent of alertness and ability to respond to questions (e.g., alert and responsive, awake, asleep, lethargic). Clinicians should be aware that level of consciousness may change or fluctuate during an <span id="ITerm34">interview</span> or even over the course of a hospital stay, particularly in inpatient settings (e.g., secondary to delirium or medication side effects) or in specific populations (e.g., in someone with dementia with Lewy Bodies). In such cases, cognitive fluctuations should be noted and described over time. It may be necessary to ascertain details of orientation through direct questioning, such as asking clients to provide the date (including day, month, and year), the name of the place in which they are being seen, and the reason for their visit. Asking the client for relevant details about the broader context of time may be useful for assessing their connection to aspects of current culture and community (e.g., “Who is the president right now<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">?</em>” or “Tell me about a recent story in the news.”).</p><p class="Para" id="Par50"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Intellectual functioning</strong>: Clinicians use the MSE to provide gross estimates about the level and range of cognitive abilities possessed by the client. While multiple theories and constructs of intelligence have been proposed and supported, for our purposes, we will consider intellectual functioning to be a summary <span id="ITerm35">description</span> of premorbid or current abilities that include fact-based, semantic knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence) as well as flexible and creative problem-solving skills (i.e., fluid intelligence). These aspects of intelligence can be informally assessed through observation of language and vocabulary use, thought content, and general fund of knowledge, as demonstrated by references in conversational speech. Much can also be gleaned by inquiring about the client’s exposure and access to formal education, the quality of that education, and the client’s ability to excel in those environments. In the absence of formal assessment measures, statements about intellectual functioning should be phrased tentatively and should indicate estimated levels or ranges of functioning only (e.g., “The client appears to be within the expected range of intellectual functioning, consistent with their educational and occupational <span id="ITerm36">attainment</span>, with no evidence of intellectual disability or cognitive deficit.”). Avoid using standardized qualitative descriptors of functioning typically associated with formal cognitive or neuropsychological testing, such as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">impaired</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">average</em>, or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">superior</em>, which may mislead the reader about the extent of assessment in this portion of the MSE.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Useful questions for assessing intelligence include, “How far did you get in school?”; “What kinds of grades did you get?”; and “What was your favorite (or least favorite) course in school?”. When working with immigrant populations, clinicians should consider differences in how education is structured and ask how school performance was measured. Furthermore, as many intelligence tests use normative groups whose first (and often only) language is English, clinicians should ask what language(s) are spoken by the client, particularly at home, and what they consider their primary or native language.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Adaptive and social functioning</strong>: For certain client populations and referral questions, it may be critically important to assess both the client’s adaptive functioning, their ability to independently function in <span id="ITerm37">everyday</span> life, and the client’s social functioning, their understanding of social norms and societal expectations about behavior. Older adult clients who may be experiencing cognitive decline, individuals who are severely depressed or manic, and clients who have limited or diminished physical or mental capacity may need assistance with functional tasks and interpersonal relationships. Assessing a client’s adaptive and social functioning helps the clinician understand how the client functions in the world and what external supports or skills training they may need as part of treatment. In the context of a brief MSE, the clinician can ask about the client’s ability to independently perform <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">activities of daily living</em> <span id="ITerm38">(ADLs)</span>, such as toileting and transferring out of bed, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">independent activities of daily living</em> (IADLs), such as financial or medication management, driving or navigation, and organization of appointments. To assess social functioning, the clinician may pose hypothetical scenarios to the client and ask them to describe the actions they would take to solve the problem or complete the <span id="ITerm39">task</span>. The client’s responses are then evaluated to ensure that the client understands all relevant safety concerns and social demands. Inquiry into the client’s vocational choices, daily health and hygiene habits, and hobbies or extracurricular activities can provide a context to specific scenarios. Some example questions include, “If you saw a customer in line at the register drop a hundred-dollar bill from their pocket, what would you do?”; “Why is it important to take your medication as prescribed?”; and “If you were home alone and heard a knock on the door at night, but weren’t expecting any guests, what would you do?”</p><p class="Para" id="Par53"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Attention</strong>: <span id="ITerm40">Assessment</span> of a client’s attention may include auditory, visual, and tactile perception, as well as an estimate of overall attentional capacity. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Auditory attention</em> is easily assessed through conversation with the client; if the client is responsive in conversation and compliant with clinician requests or commands, simple auditory attention and language comprehension can both be assumed intact. <span id="ITerm41"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Visual attention</em></span> may be assessed through requests for the client to identify and describe visually presented stimuli. <span id="ITerm42"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Tactile attention</em></span> and perception may be assessed by asking the client to close their eyes and discern the name of an object placed in their hands or the number or letter drawn onto their palm with a fingertip. The client’s overall attentional capacity and ability to work with information in immediate consciousness can be assessed through serial subtractions (i.e., serial sevens, or counting down from 100 by seven), recitation of alternating number-letter sequences (i.e., oral Trail Making Test), or by asking the client to spell W-O-R-L-D backward. Forward and backward digit span sequencing is also an efficient and meaningful assessment of immediate attention and working memory capacity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Memory</strong>: Assessing a client’s memory can be challenging without standardized assessment. Frequently, the client will serve as the sole historian during the clinical interview, making it challenging for the clinician to verify details of remote or autobiographical memory. If reliability is in question, obtaining consent to speak with a collateral informant and accessing past records is advisable. Memory assessment should cover remote, short- and long-term, and prospective <span id="ITerm43">memory</span>. Clients need intact <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">remote</em> and autobiographical memory to report symptom history, frequency, and course accurately. Certain conditions may hinder clients from accurately providing details necessary for diagnosis. For example, clients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment may forget the onset of memory problems and recent memory difficulties. Those with psychosis or mood fluctuations may struggle to characterize symptom durations accurately. <span id="ITerm44"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Confabulation</em></span>, where clients provide inaccurate but plausible information due to memory difficulties, can occur. Clinicians can verify remote memory by asking for objective facts or events confirmable through public domain or additional sources. For example, clients can be asked to recite recent US presidents to assess remote memory, though cultural considerations should be noted (e.g., a recent immigrant may not be aware of the previous U.S. presidents). Tailoring questions to the client’s interests, such as sports (e.g., team roster, game outcome), can provide verifiable information for confirmation of remote memory. To assess a client’s short- and long-term memory, the clinician may ask the client to repeat several words immediately after hearing them. Asking for the same words 30 s to 3 min later can provide a quick measure of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">immediate memory</em>. If the clinician inserts a longer delay period, up to 30 min, the clinician can later ask the client to repeat these words as a measure of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">long-term storage and retrieval</em>. More nuanced measures of information encoding and retrieval can be assessed through a series of increasingly more assistive steps. A category cue can be provided to the client to help elicit recall of those words not spontaneously produced (e.g., “One of the words on the list was a type of fruit.”). If additional structure is needed to facilitate recall, a set of three, multiple-choice options can be presented. Many of these brief assessment methods are embedded within formal assessments of cognition and mental status such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Prospective memory</em> refers to the recall of future events and is crucial for daily tasks like attending appointments and taking medication. Clinicians can assess it by asking about upcoming appointments and the methods clients use to remember important events, such as calendars or reminders.</p><div class="Para" id="Par55"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Abstract reasoning</strong>: The quality of the client’s higher order thinking and reasoning ability can also be <span id="ITerm45">assessed</span> during the interview and conveyed in the MSE. This would include aspects of creative or novel problem-solving as well as evaluation of concrete and abstract thinking patterns. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Abstract thinking</em> is an important developmental process necessary for understanding complex concepts as well as the broader relationships among things, beyond physical or tangible properties. Abstract reasoning can be assessed directly by asking the client to identify similarities between two objects or concepts (e.g., “In what way are a bike and a train alike?”). The client’s response should ideally capture the broad relationship and commonality between the two entities. In the above example, the client should understand that both entities are modes of <span id="ITerm46">transportation</span>. Clients who are incapable of abstract reasoning may define each term separately, focusing on the ways in which the concepts are distinct or opposite from one another. Alternatively, some clients may produce overly concrete and simplistic descriptions of tangible properties (e.g., they both have wheels). Consider this description of the client’s cognition:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par56"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mr. Smith is a 75-year-old, non-Hispanic white man, who was alert and oriented to the place, year, and situation, but struggled to produce details about the time (</em>e.g.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">, month/day/date). Auditory attention was intact, and he was able to repeat 4 digits forward and 3 digits in reverse order. Mr. Smith’s premorbid intellectual functioning was within normal and expected limits, as evidenced by his vocabulary use and the grammatical structure of his speech, consistent with his self-reported educational attainment of an Associate’s degree.</em></p></blockquote></div></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Factors Influencing Interpretation of the MSE</h3><p class="Para" id="Par57">Several factors, including the client’s personal strengths, credibility, trustworthiness, and accuracy as a historian, will influence both the interpretations within the MSE and the general diagnostic interview. Intact cognitive abilities are a necessary but not sufficient requisite for adequate reliability, insight, and judgment. Some clients with normal, or even superior, cognitive abilities will display difficulty with reliability, insight, and judgment because of their psychiatric disorder. Thus, it is important for clinicians to comment on these factors in the MSE.</p><p class="Para" id="Par58"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Reliability</strong>: Specific client populations as well as individual personality factors will influence the <span id="ITerm47"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">reliability</em></span> of information presented during the MSE. Though reliability and honesty of the client cannot be directly measured through interview alone, certain behaviors from the client can signal the need for cautious interpretation. For example, clients may exaggerate or over endorse symptoms, resulting in inconsistent or atypical depictions of common disorders. On rare occasions, clients may present a history or list of symptoms that appears to be rehearsed. Clients who are emotionally tied to receiving a specific outcome or diagnosis from the clinician, as in cases where secondary gain is possible, may be particularly well-practiced in providing the diagnostic criteria for a given condition. Formal research has suggested that even certain aspects of client appearance and presentation may suggest unreliability (e.g., the “sunglasses sign;” Bengtzen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>). Those with suspected memory or cognitive issues, those experiencing the more severe and chronic mental disorders, and those for whom impression <span id="ITerm48">management</span> is particularly important will present unique challenges for gathering and interpreting reliable information. In cases where reliability appears limited, additional sources of information can be sought following the MSE. A clinician may request permission to contact collateral informants and/or conduct objective personality and cognitive assessment, including measures of symptom validity and client effort.</p><p class="Para" id="Par59"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Insight and judgment</strong>: The client’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">insight</em> is a qualitative decision made by the clinician that captures an overall sense of the client’s personal awareness of symptoms and prognosis. Insight is typically described through one of several ranked descriptors, ranging from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absent</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">poor</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">limited</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">partial</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">fair</em>, to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">good</em>. The <span id="ITerm49">determination</span> will depend upon the client’s understanding of their disorder or problem(s), how pervasive symptoms are in daily life, and any deleterious influence on social, educational, or occupational functioning. Details about the client’s level of insight may be communicated through their descriptions of current emotional prognosis, evaluation of current circumstances or establishment of plans or goals.</p><div class="Para" id="Par60">A client’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">judgment</em>, as an extension of insight, describes their capacity to make appropriate decisions over a longer period, given their understanding of both self and relevant external factors. Many clients with psychiatric disorders show patterns of impaired judgment. Judgment is reflected through the client’s behaviors in daily life. As such, the clinician’s description of client judgment is best captured by statements that include, “as evidenced by” with references to illustrative client behavior (e.g., “<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The client’s judgment is impaired as evidenced by their decision to discontinue their antipsychotic medication against medical advice, following expected symptom improvement.</em>”). Helpful questions for assessing insight include open-ended probes, such as “What brings you here today?”; “What seems to be the problem?”; “What do you think is causing your problems?”; and “How do you understand your problems?”; all of which elicit the client’s opinion of themself and their current functioning. Clients’ answers to these questions are essential when assessing their decision-making capacity, which clinicians are often called upon to assess in medical settings. Consider this clinical example describing some of these factors:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par61"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ms. Gonzalez, an 82-year-old, Hispanic Black woman, did not appear to be an accurate historian for details related to her recent stroke and the associated symptom course that followed. She struggled to spontaneously recall details from her hospital stay and repeated herself several times during the overall interview, having forgotten previous portions of the conversation. Ms. Gonzalez noted her forgetfulness and word-finding difficulties, demonstrating fair insight into recent cognitive changes.</em></p></blockquote></div><p class="Para" id="Par62"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Strengths</strong>: Client <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">strengths</em> are an important part of the MSE as they may influence treatment; these subjective traits and <span id="ITerm50">factors</span> are identified by the clinician throughout the MSE and may be highlighted in sessions to help establish and build rapport. Strengths are based on clinician observation; however, clinicians may also choose to ask clients what they believe their strengths are or how those close to them would describe their strengths, aiding in the assessment of insight. Examples of strengths include resilience, persistence, sense of humor, strong social support, engagement in care (e.g., showing up to appointments), and so forth. Discussing the client’s <span id="ITerm51">strengths</span> alongside diagnostic impressions can help instill hope, inform treatment planning, and strengthen motivation for and engagement in subsequent treatment. Evaluation of client strengths, like evaluation of reliability and insight, may only be possible toward the end of session or after multiple encounters; however, identification of strengths is a fruitful and fulfilling aspect of treatment, for both clients and clinicians, that helps color diagnostic interpretation and overall prognosis.</p><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeOverview" id="FPar1"><div class="Heading">Case Example of a Structured Mental Status <span id="ITerm52">Exam</span></div><div class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par63"><div class="Table" id="Taba"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">General observations</em>: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">arrival and appearance</em></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Ms. Nguyen, a 23-year-old, heterosexual Vietnamese American woman, presented on time and alone to her intake for outpatient psychotherapy.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading">Conducting the Assessment</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h3><div class="Para" id="Par64">The goal of a psychiatric evaluation, psychotherapy intake, neuropsychological assessment, or other clinical activity is to identify and specify the presence of client abnormalities and difficulties. Using a structured MSE facilitates communication with the client and makes it easier to identify changes in the client’s presentation and functioning. Furthermore, it aids in assessing the severity of the client’s problems or psychopathology by establishing a standard of comparison across clients and over time. To set the client at ease, develop rapport, and increase the likelihood that the data gathered are comprehensive, reliable, and valid, clinicians should show genuine concern for the client, have awareness of their cultural background, and incorporate some degree of individualization. While much of the MSE is obtained through observation and questioning (e.g., asking about mood, thought content, perceptual disturbances, and suicidal and homicidal ideation), clinicians may utilize brief assessments to gather mental status and cognitive functioning information and guide further evaluation. For example, clinicians may use a brief screening tool to assess global cognition, such as the MoCA or the Saint Louis University Mental Status exam (SLUMS; Tariq et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). The clock drawing test is another quick assessment of global functioning that is quick and easy to administer to those with intact upper extremity function, and it can be scored either qualitatively or by using standardized criteria. As an initial screen of cognitive abilities, the test is non-threatening to most clients, familiar and interpretable across disciplines, and easy to incorporate within even very brief interviews (Strub &amp; Black, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">1977</a></span>). See Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">4.1</a></span> for client examples of the clock drawing test, demonstrating both intact and impaired responses. Quick visual assessment of the client’s response can provide details about their level of current functioning, planning abilities, sensory neglect, and other deficits.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_4_Chapter/106097_6_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.38em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 4.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Client clock drawing examples, demonstrating varying cognitive status and ability.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec10"><h3 class="Heading">Contextual Factors</h3><p class="Para" id="Par65"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Settings</strong>: The diagnostic interview in general, and the MSE in particular, may vary somewhat depending on the clinical setting, client population, and referral source. The format of the MSE will depend on both the clinician’s specialty training as well as the intended audience of the clinical documentation. For example, clinicians who work in hospital emergency department and inpatient <span id="ITerm53">psychiatric</span> settings may be more familiar than their outpatient counterparts with assessing and noting thought disorders and perceptual disturbances, as they may encounter more individuals in a psychotic, manic, or severely agitated state. Clinicians in outpatient mental health clinics see the gamut of mental health conditions but often encounter individuals with a degree of stability and functional success that allows them to live in the community. Nonetheless, such clinicians will likely be aware of the importance of querying for latent symptoms of <span id="ITerm54">psychosis</span>, personality disorders (particularly borderline personality disorder), substance use, and suicidality. Neuropsychologists and neurologists will likely be attuned to signs of motor disturbances and cognitive impairment. Providers across many disciplines and settings (e.g., clinical psychology, psychiatry, social work, rehabilitation medicine, primary care/family medicine, neurology, private practice mental health) use some form of an MSE, although the write-up of the intake evaluation or clinical encounter may take a different form depending on setting. Most importantly, the language of the MSE should facilitate communication among the many professionals who may interact with both the clinical documentation and the client. Clinicians should ground all observations of clients in evidence from the <span id="ITerm55">interview</span>; this is critical for other readers of the MSE and may be done through statements, such as “as evidenced by…,” “with…,” “characteristic of…,” “noteworthy behaviors include…,” and the like. The clinician’s goal is to produce a meaningful description of the client, based on observable evidence from the session, which can be easily interpreted by the relevant audience for a given setting. Moreover, a clinician establishes credibility as an interviewer through the ability to cite and describe the various pieces of evidence that support the somewhat subjective nature of this assessment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par66"><em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Telehealth considerations</strong></em>: <span id="ITerm56">Telehealth</span> was understudied and underused until the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, it has been generally well received and widely utilized, has improved accessibility, and will continue to be an integral part of health care. While screening tools exist for remote assessment of cognition such as telephone-based instruments derived from the MoCA (Frank et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), specific limitations related to adapting MSE to telehealth visits are important to consider.</p><p class="Para" id="Par67">Several of a clinician’s senses—including visual, auditory, and olfactory—commonly utilized in mental status assessment are limited in virtual settings. Creativity must be utilized to maximize the observation and assessment <span id="ITerm57">performed</span> within a telehealth setting. To assess appearance and gait, ambulatory clients might be asked to walk across the room in view of the camera. Screen sharing can be utilized by the clinician to administer questionnaires such as the PHQ-9. The client’s ability to navigate and interact with the technology used for the appointment can provide valuable information regarding their thought processes, memory, functional ability, and fine and gross motor skills. Furthermore, many elements of the MSE are preserved through telehealth appointments such as clinician’s using visual and auditory observations to assess mood, affect, thinking, memory, insight, etc.</p><p class="Para" id="Par68">Clinical telehealth policies should include rules regarding whether clients must be visible during sessions and where the sessions can take place (i.e., if the client or therapist is out-of-state or country for work, where licensure may be an issue). To visibly assess for safety, especially when non-suicidal self-injury is a concern, clinicians can ask the client to remain on screen with their camera on for the duration of the appointment. Knowing where the client is located is essential, should an emergency response become necessary. Clinicians should ensure clients are in a quiet, private setting to protect confidentiality. Licensing laws regarding telehealth vary by state, so it is important to adhere to state guidance.</p><p class="Para" id="Par69">Specific populations such as rural-dwelling individuals, some older adults, and those living below the poverty line may not have reliable access to the Internet or Internet-enabled devices, and therefore, telephone rather than video sessions may be the only option to facilitate care. Finally, as telehealth only recently became a feasible option for treatment, many evidence-based treatments (EBTs) previously found to be efficacious have yet to be evaluated for telehealth. Clinicians should be mindful of this when selecting appropriate EBTs for telehealth clients, though initial research shows comparable outcomes between telehealth and face-to-face interventions (Greenwood et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par70"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Populations</strong>: Varied clinical populations benefit from adjustments to the MSE or additional special considerations, relative to the clinical setting and goals of the evaluation. For all clients, a thorough MSE includes individualized observation and person-centered interpretation. The clinician can increase inclusivity and appropriateness of MSE procedures by considering some additional, population-specific features.</p><p class="Para" id="Par71"><em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Cultural considerations</strong></em>: The MSE is subjective and influenced by cultural background; for instance, immigrants or those from impoverished backgrounds may lack certain knowledge (e.g., reciting recent US presidents). Non-native English speakers may use different vocabulary to convey subjective experiences. Cultural <span id="ITerm58">factors</span> like education quality and access affect cognitive assessment. Non-white racial/ethnic minorities may perform differently on standardized tests originally normed and developed in predominantly non-Hispanic white samples. Clinicians should choose assessments considering factors like age, race, education, and culture, ideally administered in the client’s native language.</p><p class="Para" id="Par72">With respect to culture, we emphasize the distinction between “different” and “pathological,” wherein the former is a subjective determination best contextualized by the culture of the client. This may be the case with cultural concepts of distress, such as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ataque de nervios</em>, a constellation of physical and emotional responses to a stressor endorsed by Hispanic/Latino individuals (particularly Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban individuals; Lewis-Fernández &amp; López, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). Similarly, individuals from Asian cultures may be more likely to report somatic symptoms of distress rather than emotional symptoms (Haroz et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Clinicians can best clarify their understanding of a client’s experience by reflecting the client’s own language and choice of vocabulary back to them during the session, with an attempt to understand the client’s meaning. Tools like the Cultural Formulation Interview (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) can be utilized by clinicians to better understand the client’s cultural background and current functioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par73"><em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Neurodevelopmental considerations</strong></em>: When working with individuals with intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) and ASD, sensitivity is crucial due to their unique communication styles, cognitive differences, and attentional challenges. Establishing rapport with both the client and caregiver(s) is essential. Activities like drawing or completing puzzles together may facilitate rapport-building and provide insight into the individual’s typical environment. Consider thought content, emotional <span id="ITerm59">expression</span>, and psychomotor behavior within the context of a neurodevelopmental condition to avoid misclassification. For instance, someone with ASD may appear indifferent or lack expression, potentially misinterpreted as flat affect seen in schizophrenia. Ideas expressed by those with neurodevelopmental conditions may resemble delusions due to lack of evidence; thus, thorough history-taking and review with knowledgeable caregivers are crucial.</p><p class="Para" id="Par74"><em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Aging</strong></em>: Developmental considerations are also crucial for aging, older adult clients, as mental disorders often manifest differently with increased age. Age-appropriate assessments are essential (see Segal et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). For instance, older adults with depressive symptoms may express somatic and cognitive complaints rather than sadness, which may be challenging to differentiate from medical concerns (Fiske et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>; Haigh et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Historical context, such as a person’s birth cohort (e.g., the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers), can influence symptom presentation, including a reluctance to disclose emotional vulnerability. Clinicians should be aware of implicit ageist beliefs that may affect appropriate inquiry into substance use, sexual behaviors, and suicidal or homicidal thinking. It’s important to recognize that cognitive decline is just one of many potential concerns for older clients, and that many older individuals will not experience significant cognitive declines at all.</p><p class="Para" id="Par75"><em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Medical populations</strong></em>: Certain medical conditions may cause altered mental status or expression of psychiatric symptoms. Clinicians should therefore collect medical history whenever possible, and clinicians should ask the client about their past and current medications. Asking about medications may clue the clinician into existing medical conditions which may be contributing to abnormal presentation during the MSE or may alert the clinician to potential drug interactions. Medical populations and older adults are often prescribed multiple medications, compounding the risk for adverse reactions.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec11"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par76">The mental status exam (MSE) is an important foundation upon which to develop impressions of a client’s psychiatric diagnosis. By observing and assessing overall appearance and behavior, quality of thought and speech, and emotional and cognitive functioning, a clinician begins to develop a working hypothesis of diagnostic impressions and specific avenues for further assessment and inquiry. Functioning across the domains of the MSE is best understood through an integrative biopsychosocial approach that emphasizes reciprocal relationships among these factors.</p><p class="Para" id="Par77">The core elements of the MSE, as described within this chapter, structure the assessment and provide the reader with a common vocabulary for describing the various components of the evaluation. As a shared tool across clinical disciplines, the MSE should facilitate interdisciplinary communication and highlight evidence used for diagnosis. The MSE paints a description of the client and guides diagnostic hypotheses, facilitating treatment decisions and a patient-centered approach to care. Conducting a thorough MSE improves with clinical experience, particularly as clinicians encounter an increasingly diverse array of client populations across multiple settings.</p></section>
