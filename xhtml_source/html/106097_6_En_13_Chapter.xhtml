The four ED diagnoses described in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em>; American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and “other specified feeding or eating disorder” (OSFED).</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Approximately 82% of all EDs will onset by age 25 (Solmi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Age-of-onset varies by ED, with age of onset for AN typically occurring in early-to-middle adolescence and age-of-onset for BN and BED <span id="ITerm11">occurring</span> in the late teenage years to young adulthood. Prevalence rates for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> EDs in adolescents are 5.7% in females and 1.2% in males (Smink et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). Epidemiologic research conducted in Australia reported a 3-month point prevalence rate of 16.3% for any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> ED, with most ED cases accounted for by BED and OSFED (Hay et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). Research in the United States found a combined ED prevalence of 13.1% by age 20 (Stice et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Thus, in contrast to views of EDs as rare psychiatric disorders, they are relatively common in the general population. In the following <span id="ITerm12">sections</span>, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> diagnostic criteria for EDs are described.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Anorexia Nervosa</h3><p class="Para" id="Par4"><span id="ITerm13">AN</span><span id="ITerm14"/> is characterized by restriction of energy intake that results in a significantly low body weight, given a person’s age, sex, and other developmental and physical health factors (Criterion A). Persons with AN may display an intense fear of weight gain <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">or</em> engage in persistent behaviors to avoid weight gain (Criterion B). People with AN may report a distorted perception of their weight and body shape, deny the seriousness of their low body weight, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">or</em> base their self-evaluation on their weight or shape (Criterion C). It is important to note that a person with AN may not report concerns with body image or perceptual disturbance but may still meet criteria if there are persistent behaviors that are designed to prevent weight gain (e.g., excessive exercise, restricting food intake, etc.) and the person does not think that <span id="ITerm15">their</span><span id="ITerm16"/><span id="ITerm17"/><span id="ITerm18"/><span id="ITerm19"/><span id="ITerm20"/><span id="ITerm21"/><span id="ITerm22"/><span id="ITerm23"/> low weight is a problem.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">Body <span id="ITerm24">weight</span><span id="ITerm25"/> is typically assessed in adults by calculating a person’s <span id="ITerm26">body mass index (BMI)</span>; for children and adolescents, additional information conveyed by BMI-for-age percentiles should be considered to account for growth trajectories. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> does not provide a specific BMI cutoff for defining “significantly low body weight.” However, BMI cut-offs are included in the new <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> severity categories for AN that define severity based on BMI thresholds that range from mild to extreme.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> specifies two subtypes for AN: (1) restricting, in which no binge eating or purging behaviors occur, and (2) binge-eating/purging, in which the person engages in binge eating and/or purging behaviors, such as self-induced <span id="ITerm27">vomiting</span><span id="ITerm28"/>, laxative, and/or diuretic misuse.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Bulimia Nervosa</h3><p class="Para" id="Par7"><span id="ITerm29">BN</span><span id="ITerm30"/> is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior at least once per week (on average) for a period of 3 months. The person must also report that their self-evaluation is unduly influenced by their shape and weight. An individual cannot concurrently meet the criteria for <span id="ITerm31">AN</span><span id="ITerm32"/><span id="ITerm33"/><span id="ITerm34"/><span id="ITerm35"/><span id="ITerm36"/><span id="ITerm37"/><span id="ITerm38"/><span id="ITerm39"/> and BN. Thus, significantly low body weight is an exclusion criterion for BN and an inclusion criterion for AN.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">An objective binge-eating episode refers to a discrete period (e.g., within 2 hours) in which an individual consumes an objectively large amount of food, in addition to experiencing a sense of <span id="ITerm40">loss-of-control (LOC)</span>. Although there are no caloric guidelines for what is considered objectively large, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> indicates that the amount eaten needs to be “definitely larger” than what most other people would eat under similar circumstances. Interviewers may also want to consider the person’s body size and height, gender, and physical activity patterns when making judgments of <span id="ITerm41">whether</span><span id="ITerm42"/> the <span id="ITerm43">eating </span><span id="ITerm44"/><span id="ITerm45"/><span id="ITerm46"/><span id="ITerm47"/><span id="ITerm48"/><span id="ITerm49"/><span id="ITerm50"/><span id="ITerm51"/>episodes are objectively large. <span id="ITerm52">LOC</span> may be expressed by individuals in terms that include, but are not limited to, feeling as though binge-episodes were inevitable, like they could not stop eating once they started (e.g., like a ball rolling down a hill), or that they could not control what or how much was consumed. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and clients may have other lay terminology to describe their own subjective experience of LOC. For example, Forbush et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>) found that people who experience binge eating may characterize <span id="ITerm53">LOC</span> as mild, <span id="ITerm54">transient </span><span id="ITerm55"/>dissociation (e.g., not realizing how much they were eating until after they had finished or feeling that they were on “autopilot”). See the dialogue for an example of how to assess for binge-eating episodes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9"><span id="ITerm56">Inappropriate compensatory behaviors (ICBs)</span> are categorized into purging and non-purging methods. Purging ICBs refer to the forced expelling of food from the body (through means such as self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics) or misuse of certain substances (e.g., insulin omission in persons with Type I diabetes or misuse of thyroid medicine to prevent weight gain or compensate for an eating episode). Non-purging ICBs refer to <span id="ITerm57">non-purging </span><span id="ITerm58"/><span id="ITerm59"/><span id="ITerm60"/><span id="ITerm61"/><span id="ITerm62"/><span id="ITerm63"/><span id="ITerm64"/><span id="ITerm65"/>behaviors that are used to compensate for binge-episodes, such as by excessive <span id="ITerm66">exercise</span><span id="ITerm67"/> or caloric restriction.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Binge Eating Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm68">BED</span><span id="ITerm69"/> requires that an individual engage in recurrent episodes of binge eating (see above) in the absence of low body weight and ICBs. In addition, an individual must meet criteria for three out of five associated features for BED, such as (1) eating much more rapidly than normal, (2) eating until uncomfortably full, (3) eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry, (4) eating alone due to embarrassment associated with how much one is eating, and (5) feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty after a binge. Finally, binge eating must cause marked distress.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders</h3><p class="Para" id="Par11">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> <span id="ITerm70">also</span><span id="ITerm71"/> includes a category called “OSFED” to encompass ED presentations that cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet diagnostic criteria for AN, BN, or BED. OSFED is the most common ED diagnosis. OSFED does not necessarily imply that the person’s ED is less severe, but rather encompasses the large proportion of serious ED presentations that do not cleanly fit into the other diagnostic categories. A meta-analysis of mortality rates in the various ED diagnoses identified similar mortality rates in OSFED compared to full-threshold EDs (Solmi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> provides five specific examples of presentations that fall within the OSFED category. For example, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">atypical AN</em> <span id="ITerm72">(atypAN)</span> is an OSFED characterized by significant, <span id="ITerm73">substantial </span><span id="ITerm74"/><span id="ITerm75"/><span id="ITerm76"/><span id="ITerm77"/><span id="ITerm78"/><span id="ITerm79"/><span id="ITerm80"/><span id="ITerm81"/>weight loss (not better explained by a medical condition); yet, despite the significant weight loss, the <span id="ITerm82">individual’s </span><span id="ITerm83"/>weight is within or above a minimally healthy range. Given that the person with atypAN may have developed their illness at a higher baseline weight, this diagnosis is provided to intervene earlier in the illness course, rather than waiting until the person reaches a significantly low body weight. <span id="ITerm84"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Purging disorder</em></span> is an OSFED in which an individual engages in recurrent purging behavior to influence their weight or shape in the absence of objective binge-eating episodes. <span id="ITerm85"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Night eating syndrome</em></span> is an OSFED characterized by recurrent consumption of food after waking up from sleep or the excessive consumption of food following an evening meal. Notably, the individual has full awareness and recollection of food consumption, which differentiates it from parasomnias such as sleep-related eating disorders. Other OSFEDs include BN and BED of lower frequency or duration. Lastly, in addition to the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> examples of OSFEDs, compensatory eating disorder is a newly proposed <span id="ITerm86">OSFED</span><span id="ITerm87"/> in which a person engages in recurrent non-purging compensatory behavior (e.g., excessive exercise and/or restriction) to influence their <span id="ITerm88">weight/shape</span><span id="ITerm89"/><span id="ITerm90"/><span id="ITerm91"/><span id="ITerm92"/><span id="ITerm93"/><span id="ITerm94"/><span id="ITerm95"/><span id="ITerm96"/> in the absence of objective binge eating episodes (Negi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par13">Although <span id="ITerm97">Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</span><span id="ITerm98"/> is designated in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> as a feeding disorder, not an ED, we included ARFID in this chapter because cases of ARFID are often seen in ED treatment settings. ARFID, which can occur within individuals of all ages, is characterized by avoidant or restrictive eating behavior resulting in substantial weight loss or nutritional deficiency or marked psychosocial impairment. An important indicator of ARFID is that the restrictive eating behaviors are not driven by weight or body image concerns. Three common features (though not exhaustive) that can contribute to disturbances in eating among individuals with ARFID include: (1) an <span id="ITerm99">apparent</span><span id="ITerm100"/><span id="ITerm101"/><span id="ITerm102"/><span id="ITerm103"/><span id="ITerm104"/><span id="ITerm105"/><span id="ITerm106"/><span id="ITerm107"/> lack of interest in eating; (2) an avoidance based on the sensory characteristics (e.g., smells, tastes, textures, temperatures, and appearances) of food; and (3) a concern about the aversive consequences of eating, such as choking or <span id="ITerm108">contracting </span><span id="ITerm109"/>an illness or disease from food.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Due to the consequences of nutritional deficiency in both AN and ARFID, there are considerable similarities in how these two disorders present clinically (Kambanis &amp; Thomas, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). It is important to note, however, that body-image disturbances and persistent behaviors to prevent weight gain are not a component of the ARFID diagnosis in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR.</em> For this reason, it can be particularly difficult to differentiate cases of ARFID from cases of AN in which symptoms of fat phobia are absent. To make a definitive diagnosis of ARFID, the clinician must rule out AN and BN, and ARFID symptoms should not be attributable to cultural practices, a lack of food resources, or a medical condition <span id="ITerm110">that</span><span id="ITerm111"/> better explains low weight.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><div class="Para" id="Par15">EDs are <span id="ITerm112">complex</span> psychiatric disorders that, if left untreated, result in substantial psychiatric and medical morbidity and high mortality rates (Nielsen &amp; Vilmar, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR51" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Given that EDs have the second highest mortality rate of any mental disorder after opioid-use disorders (Chesney et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>), proper assessment and early diagnosis are essential. Procedures for clinical interviewing should be given careful consideration, including identifying the problem areas, establishing <span id="ITerm113">rapport</span><span id="ITerm114"/><span id="ITerm115"/><span id="ITerm116"/><span id="ITerm117"/><span id="ITerm118"/><span id="ITerm119"/><span id="ITerm120"/><span id="ITerm121"/>, and providing appropriate clinical recommendations (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">13.1</a></span> for “Dos and Don’ts”). In addition to utilizing well-validated self-report and interview-based tools to ensure proper diagnosis, it is important for clinicians to include the following additional components in their unstructured clinical interviews: (1) weight and dieting history; (2) current and past patterns of disordered-eating behaviors and cognitions [including binge eating, ICBs, <span id="ITerm122">and </span>body dissatisfaction (including desire for greater muscularity)]; (3) history of weight-based teasing or bullying; (4) social support and relationships; (5) suicidal ideation, self-harm, and suicide attempt histories; and (6) treatment history.<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 13.1</span><p class="SimplePara">Dos and don’ts</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Establish positive rapport. Many ED behaviors may be associated with embarrassment, guilt, shame, and/or secrecy. Moreover, treatment-seeking rates for individuals with EDs are low; thus, it is not uncommon for an ED assessment to be the first time an individual has discussed their ED thoughts and behaviors with someone</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Take a nonjudgmental stance when assessing ED symptoms. Try to use language that normalizes disordered thoughts and behaviors. For example, when asking someone to describe what they ate during a binge-eating episode, it may be helpful to ask, “What else?” (which assumes there is more food that was eaten), rather than “Anything else?” (which subtly implies that there should not be more food that was eaten). It can be helpful to reassure the person being assessed that you would not know to ask these questions about their experience if ED issues were not experienced by many people</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Work on your own internalized weight bias. Our society places value on thinness for women and leanness (muscularity) for men and any internalized bias (even unconscious bias) that you may have toward people of higher body weights could be conveyed to your client, hindering your ability to do an effective interview</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Be mindful of your facial expressions and reactions during an interview. Sometimes binge-eating episodes can be quite a bit larger than what most people would eat under similar circumstances (e.g., a full jar of peanut butter and loaf of bread) or seem un-palatable (e.g., raw hot dogs). Keeping a neutral expression and familiarizing yourself with the full range of eating behaviors can help you to avoid passing judgment. Maintaining a nonjudgmental stance, in turn, can help you get better quality information from your client, which will improve your ability to assess, diagnose, and create a strong treatment plan</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Assess associated impairment in addition to specific ED symptoms. Assessing clinical impairment (e.g., how symptoms impact one’s ability to engage in interpersonal relationships, at work or school, etc.) gives a more comprehensive description of severity. Although the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> provides a categorical system through which AN, BN, and BED severity can be quantified, clinical impairment should also be considered. Measures such as the Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA; Bohn et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>) or the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) may be informative</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Establish a timeline to describe when symptoms began and for what duration they occurred. For ED diagnoses, the presence or absence of a single symptom for a period of time can influence diagnosis (e.g., the presence or absence of ICBs influences whether a diagnosis of BN or BED is appropriate)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Get specific details of an individual’s restricting and/or binge-eating episodes. For instance, someone may be able to estimate how many cups or teaspoons of food they ate, or they may be able to provide the brand name of a food that can then be researched to provide additional information. Additionally, do not assume that binge-eating episodes must feature “junk food.” Many persons who binge eat consume “healthy foods” during their binge-eating episodes (e.g., eating an entire package of baby carrots). Consider the volume and amount of food relative to what most other people would eat in a similar situation when evaluating binge-eating episodes. Finally, consider a person’s energy balance needs when evaluating binge-eating and restricting episodes. A 6′4″ man who exercises for 2 hours/day will require more energy from food than a woman who does not exercise and is 5′0″ tall. Similarly, a woman of 5′4″ who weighs 400 pounds will require more energy to maintain her weight than a woman of 5′4″ who weighs 135 pounds. In other words, what constitutes a large amount of food will vary depending on the person’s specific energy input and output</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Be sure to ask about the context of a person’s binge-eating or restricting episodes. For example, persons who observe Ramadan practice fasting; yet, this does not preclude these periods of fasting to be considered inappropriate compensatory behavior (in addition to religious practices). Comprehensive questioning, such as clarifying if the individual is motivated to engage in this behavior in any part because of weight/shape impact, can help elucidate ED behaviors that may accompany other, day-to-day behaviors. An additional example of the importance of context might be an instance in which an individual reports binge eating on a holiday (such as Thanksgiving) or at a particular restaurant where portions are typically quite large (such as the Cheesecake Factory); as it would normative for a person to eat an objectively large amount under such circumstances, it can be helpful to consider what amount of food would be reasonable given the setting</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Do: Be patient! EDs can significantly impact a person’s insight and ability to describe their experience. Keep in mind that certain aspects of EDs, such as overvaluation of weight and shape, can be challenging to assess. Individuals may have limited insight into these symptoms or may not respond to a particular way of evaluating these concepts. For example, some individuals may not endorse loss-of-control (LOC) during their binge-eating episodes yet describe a sense of inevitability that they would consume a large amount of food; the latter fulfills the LOC criterion for binge-eating episodes and represents an alternative way to characterize LOC. Certain phrasing and descriptions of ED concepts may resonate with some individuals more so than others</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Don’t: Do not make assumptions about a person’s ED based on his or her appearance (including body weight or shape). EDs occur in persons of all ethnicities, ages, genders, and body sizes. We simply cannot know whether a person has an ED based on their appearance</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Don’t: Do not assume a person’s current ED presentation has been their primary lifetime ED presentation. For example, if a person currently meets criteria for bulimia nervosa and indicates that there was a time in which they were binge eating without engaging in ICBs, binge ED history should also be considered. Furthermore, if a person currently engages in non-purging ICBs (e.g., fasting), this does not preclude them from having a history of purging behaviors (e.g., laxative misuse)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Don’t: Do not forget to consider important factors such as gender, cultural background, and other individual differences when formulating your case conceptualization. In special populations such as athletes, for example, the same amount of exercise that would be deemed “excessive” in an average person may not be considered excessive given the demands of their sport training</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par16">We find it useful to collaboratively develop a timeline of the ED behaviors and cognitions that begins with the person’s first eating disorder behavior until the present time. The interviewer should attempt to gather information on the temporal relationships between past eating disorder behaviors and weight fluctuations. For example, if an individual has a history of dieting, the interviewer will want to know how much weight was lost after the first attempt to diet, over what period of time the diet occurred, how much was consumed during that time, what other behaviors occurred during and <span id="ITerm123">after</span> the diet ceased, and how the behaviors and thoughts affected their day-to-day functioning, social relationships, and their self-image. The interviewer will also want <span id="ITerm124">to </span><span id="ITerm125"/><span id="ITerm126"/><span id="ITerm127"/><span id="ITerm128"/><span id="ITerm129"/><span id="ITerm130"/><span id="ITerm131"/><span id="ITerm132"/>obtain the client’s lowest and highest body weights for their height (excluding pregnancy) and inquire about the eating behaviors, ICBs, and physical activity patterns the person was engaging in during that time. Obtaining a full weight history is important because people often “migrate” among ED diagnoses over time (e.g., from AN to BN) without recovering. Thus, obtaining information on weight history will enable the clinician to see the “full picture” with respect to the scope and severity of the ED. Throughout the diagnostic interviewing process, the interviewer should work to remain nonjudgmental, supportive, and collaborative, while also obtaining detailed information necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan. Given that lay definitions of various ED <span id="ITerm133">behaviors</span> differ from clinical and diagnostic definitions, we encourage the clinician to err on the side of obtaining objective information and informant reports, when appropriate.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">Finally, it is important that clinicians <span id="ITerm134">are</span><span id="ITerm135"/><span id="ITerm136"/><span id="ITerm137"/><span id="ITerm138"/><span id="ITerm139"/><span id="ITerm140"/><span id="ITerm141"/><span id="ITerm142"/> sensitive to the physical and cognitive needs of clients with EDs. Clinics that see people with EDs should be able to accommodate a full range of body shapes and sizes. For example, there should be sufficient seat padding or extra cushions to prevent people with low body weights from bruising and bariatric-sized chairs for people with higher body weights. Keep in mind how embarrassing it would feel if you were a client who was seeking help for your eating <span id="ITerm143">and</span> body-image issues, and you could not fit through the clinic front doors, or you sat down and broke a clinic chair! You will also want to be mindful of the fact that clients who are malnourished may be slow to respond to questions or be forgetful. It is important to note that malnutrition is not perfectly aligned with body weight—many clients who are severely restricting their food intake (including clients living in larger bodies) may experience cognitive effects associated with inadequate caloric intake. Thus, depending on the client’s needs, the clinician may want to break up the intake <span id="ITerm144">session </span><span id="ITerm145"/><span id="ITerm146"/><span id="ITerm147"/><span id="ITerm148"/><span id="ITerm149"/><span id="ITerm150"/><span id="ITerm151"/><span id="ITerm152"/><span id="ITerm153">into</span> a few shorter sessions.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec9"><h2 class="Heading">Recommendations for Formal Assessment</h2><p class="Para" id="Par18">We highly recommend that clinicians include some type of formal assessment (in addition to unstructured clinical interviewing) as a part of their routine assessment practice for clients with an ED. Approximately 30% of <span id="ITerm154">disorders</span> can be missed by the interviewer if unstructured interviews are administered without any formal diagnostic interview (Zimmerman &amp; Mattia, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR69" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a></span>). Other research indicates that early response in the first month of treatment as defined by 2.88% weight gain (for persons with AN) or ≥70% reduction in binge eating or purging (for persons with BED or BN) is one of the only prognostic indicators for <span id="ITerm155">end-of-treatment</span><span id="ITerm156"/><span id="ITerm157"/><span id="ITerm158"/><span id="ITerm159"/><span id="ITerm160"/><span id="ITerm161"/><span id="ITerm162"/><span id="ITerm163"/> response (Chang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Thus, formal assessment may help clinicians better understand the full diagnostic picture to inform case conceptualization, identify prognosis by monitoring early response, and make evidence-based decisions about the optimal timing and necessity of stepped care. Overall, clinicians who engage in routine assessment of cognitions and behaviors can treat clients faster and more effectively (Lewis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).

Thus, the EDE-Q is a valuable tool for clinicians interested in monitoring changes in relevant CBT-E constructs over the course of therapy. Strengths of the EDE-Q include strong reliability and internal consistency.

Although the EDI-3 has good reliability and convergent validity (Brookings et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>), the three-factor structure does not replicate in African American women (Rothstein et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>).

You can see the level of detail the therapist asked for in detailing the foods consumed. A useful guideline is to get enough detail that you could go to the store (or restaurant) and recreate the exact meal or snack. With some patients, using a portion or measurement guide may be helpful (i.e., helping them to describe their eating <span id="ITerm332">episodes</span> with descriptors like cups, <span id="ITerm333">teaspoons</span><span id="ITerm334"/><span id="ITerm335"/><span id="ITerm336"/><span id="ITerm337"/><span id="ITerm338"/><span id="ITerm339"/><span id="ITerm340"/><span id="ITerm341"/>, and ounces or indicate portion sizes using their hands). The reason for obtaining such detailed information on eating episodes is because the size of the episode (small or typical meal or snack vs. an amount that is definitely large) determines whether the person should be diagnosed with purging disorder, compensatory eating disorder, BN, or BED.</p><p class="Para" id="Par72">Another helpful strategy is to use the phrase, “What else?” in asking about foods consumed in the binge-eating episode. This phrasing tells the patient that you expect there to be more foods consumed, as opposed to the phrasing, “Anything else?” which can suggest to the client that the amount of food he or she has described is already large enough. In this dialogue, the therapist asked, “What else?” until the patient reported being finished describing the eating episode.

The therapist then asked follow-up questions to inquire about LOC in different ways that might resonate with the patient (e.g., feeling like he couldn’t stop eating once he had started and feeling it was inevitable that he would eat that amount of food). Each of these strategies was used to assess LOC, which the patient eventually endorsed. In our experience, sometimes the sense of being out-of-control over binge-eating episodes may diminish over the course of the ED illness (e.g., the client eventually plans to have a binge-eating episode each Friday night, so the planned episode does not feel as out-of-control). In situations in which it is unclear whether the client experienced LOC, it can help to ask open-ended questions to elicit their thoughts and feelings during the <span id="ITerm363">eating </span>episode. The take-home message is that even if LOC is mild, it is still considered present.</p></section>

The patient initially mentioned that her exercise was about health and that she exercised frequently for her job, but not to influence body shape or weight. Because exercise can be a healthful behavior for many people, patients with EDs will sometimes frame their exercise in a positive manner. The therapist, however, should continue to ask about the patient’s exercise pattern in a nonjudgmental manner to better understand how the ED and exercise might be related. The therapist in this case validated what the patient was saying and asked whether there was any added benefit that her shape and/or weight could be influenced by her exercise behaviors. The <span id="ITerm406">patient</span> also framed her exercise as being necessary for work, so the therapist asked detailed questions about how much effort the patient put into exercise (e.g., more than other instructors) as well as the frequency of exercise (i.e., including additional workouts in addition to teaching exercise classes as part of her job). The therapist also asked about perceived exertion to evaluate intensity (e.g., how hard was Betsy pushing herself during the activity). <span id="ITerm407">Assessing</span><span id="ITerm408"/><span id="ITerm409"/><span id="ITerm410"/><span id="ITerm411"/><span id="ITerm412"/><span id="ITerm413"/><span id="ITerm414"/><span id="ITerm415"/> perceived exertion is another way to help determine if the exercise was potentially unhealthy. It is also important to inquire about days when exercise persisted despite an injury or illness or when against medical advice. For example, in this vignette, Betsy exercised at almost her maximum intensity, even when she was sick or injured, which revealed she exercised in a rigid way despite her doctor’s orders to rest. Finally, Betsy volunteered that she exercised to compensate for an overeating episode. If she had not volunteered this information, it would <span id="ITerm416">have</span> been important for the clinician to ask if exercise was used <span id="ITerm417">to </span><span id="ITerm418"/><span id="ITerm419"/><span id="ITerm420"/><span id="ITerm421"/><span id="ITerm422"/><span id="ITerm423"/><span id="ITerm424"/><span id="ITerm425"/>compensate for an eating episode.</p></section>

Although members of ethnic-racial minority groups are not protected from developing an ED, they are less likely to receive a referral for ED assessment or treatment than European Americans (Moreno et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Even when referred for treatment, ethnic and racial minorities are less likely to utilize mental-health resources than their European-American counterparts. The lack of treatment referral and treatment receipt in ethnic-minority groups is theorized to be the <span id="ITerm427">result</span><span id="ITerm428"/><span id="ITerm429"/><span id="ITerm430"/><span id="ITerm431"/><span id="ITerm432"/><span id="ITerm433"/><span id="ITerm434"/><span id="ITerm435"/> of increased stigmatization of mental health services (Misra et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Another important consideration is the potential need to include the family in the assessment and treatment process. For example, excluding family members from clinical services could violate the Latinx cultural value of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">familismo</em>, which refers to a strong identification and attachment to nuclear <span id="ITerm436">and</span> extended families. Finally, therapists should be aware of cultural adaptations and tailor their intake interview to assess culturally relevant issues that may maintain ED behaviors. For example, Exum et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) <span id="ITerm437">theorized</span><span id="ITerm438"/> that for Black women, discrimination, strong black woman identification (cultural and societal expectations of strength), and culturally specific body-image ideals may lead to stress. In turn, ED behaviors may serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism for mitigating the high stress that Black women are exposed to in society.</p><p class="Para" id="Par116">Patients who identify as a <span id="ITerm439">member</span><span id="ITerm440"/><span id="ITerm441"/><span id="ITerm442"/><span id="ITerm443"/><span id="ITerm444"/><span id="ITerm445"/><span id="ITerm446"/><span id="ITerm447"/> of an ethnic-racial minority group who appear for services may be more likely to present with a higher level of psychiatric impairment and disorder severity (Burke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). High severity may be due to cultural stigma and discrimination, which may lead some individuals to live with ED symptoms longer and wait to seek treatment (or not receive appropriate referrals) until they are severely impaired.</p><p class="Para" id="Par117">Despite having <span id="ITerm448">greater</span> symptom severity upon initial treatment presentation, certain minority groups may simultaneously report lower body-image concerns than their European American counterparts. Researchers suggested that potential differences in body image disturbance may be due to cultural preference for “curvier” body sizes among members of certain ethnic and racial groups (Lowy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). East Asian individuals are likely to prioritize body image based on thinness, and culturally important features, such as eye shape <span id="ITerm449">and</span><span id="ITerm450"/><span id="ITerm451"/><span id="ITerm452"/><span id="ITerm453"/><span id="ITerm454"/><span id="ITerm455"/><span id="ITerm456"/><span id="ITerm457"/> complexion (Brady et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). South Asian individuals may report body image <span id="ITerm458">disturbance</span> due to pressures to achieve competing appearance ideals, weight stigma from multiple sources (e.g., mothers, relatives, and “aunties”), and pressures to possess light skin (Goel et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Finally, for first-generation ethnic-racial minorities, clinicians should evaluate the role of acculturation in the onset and maintenance of ED symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par118"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Assessment Tip:</em> During assessment and treatment, it is important to consider the cultural practices of the population. Although something may seem abnormal or maladaptive to you, it may be common practice in certain cultures. Racism, discrimination, and sexism are also risk factors for maladaptive behaviors, so maintaining cultural humility and working to the best of one’s ability to understand <span id="ITerm459">the</span> client’s experience is critical.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec21"><h3 class="Heading">Religion</h3><p class="Para" id="Par119"><span id="ITerm460">Religious</span> diets, practices, and rituals can impact ED assessment and treatment. It is crucial to disentangle religious modesty from body avoidance in various populations. <span id="ITerm461">For</span><span id="ITerm462"/><span id="ITerm463"/><span id="ITerm464"/><span id="ITerm465"/><span id="ITerm466"/><span id="ITerm467"/><span id="ITerm468"/><span id="ITerm469"/> example, <span id="ITerm470">tzniut</span> (the character trait of modesty in dressing and behavior) is an important tenet in the <span id="ITerm471">Orthodox Jewish religion</span>. Similarly, it is important to parse apart motivations for underlying eating behaviors. For example, Ramadan and Navratri are culturally sanctioned periods of religious fasting. One the one hand, it is not appropriate to pathologize culturally sanctioned eating behaviors. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that weight- and shape-related motivations for dietary restraint can co-exist with religious motivations for fasting. Thus, therapists should not assume that religion is the primary or only reason motivating fasting. We recommend <span id="ITerm472"/>that therapists ask if “any small part” of the behavior is also motivated by the desire to lose weight or compensate for an eating episode. If a client indicates that a secondary motivation of religious fasting or body avoidance is to accommodate the ED, then this <span id="ITerm473">provides</span><span id="ITerm474"/><span id="ITerm475"/><span id="ITerm476"/><span id="ITerm477"/><span id="ITerm478"/><span id="ITerm479"/><span id="ITerm480"/><span id="ITerm481"/> the therapist with an opportunity to align the client’s behaviors with their stated values.</p><p class="Para" id="Par120"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Assessment Tip</em>: When working with clients of varying religious backgrounds, it is important to practice cultural humility by doing personal work to learn more about the client’s religion, consulting with spiritual leaders, and identifying ways to honor religious practices, while also promoting ED recovery.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec22"><h3 class="Heading">Food Insecurity</h3><p class="Para" id="Par121"><span id="ITerm483">EDs</span><span id="ITerm484"/> are frequently elevated among people with food <span id="ITerm485"/><span id="ITerm486"/><span id="ITerm487"/><span id="ITerm488"/><span id="ITerm489"/><span id="ITerm490"/><span id="ITerm491"/><span id="ITerm492"/><span id="ITerm493"/>insecurity (Becker et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture as a condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food (National Research Council, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Food insecurity is disproportionately experienced by people with lower incomes, people from minoritized racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and people who identify as a sexual minority, which may be attributed to factors such as worsened socioeconomic conditions, structural racism, and discrimination. Although the mechanisms linking food insecurity to ED psychopathology are still being evaluated, one theory posits that individuals with food insecurity experience “feast-or-famine” cycles (Dinour et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>), which may drive patterns of dietary restriction and binge eating. According to this model, <span id="ITerm494">during</span><span id="ITerm495"/> times of lower food availability, some household members may restrict food intake out of necessity or to make food available <span id="ITerm496"/><span id="ITerm497"/><span id="ITerm498"/><span id="ITerm499"/><span id="ITerm500"/><span id="ITerm501"/><span id="ITerm502"/><span id="ITerm503"/><span id="ITerm504"/>to other members of the household. When food is more abundant, such as when financial resources become available, people in the <span id="ITerm505">feast-or-famine cycle</span> may be more likely to binge eat. Traditional assessments for EDs have focused on shape/weight-related motivations for dietary restraint, with no current measures specifically assessing food insecurity as a motivation for dietary restraint. It is, thus, important to ask clients if dietary restriction is due (at least in part) to limited food availability.

Compared to other EDs, men are most likely to be diagnosed with BED and to report overeating. Men are more likely to endorse a desire for a muscular figure, consistent with Western body ideals.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec24"><h3 class="Heading">Persons Who Are Transgender or Gender Diverse</h3><p class="Para" id="Par124">Gender <span id="ITerm518">plays</span><span id="ITerm519"/> a critical role in how EDs are experienced. The experience of gender for many people is fluid and better defined as a continuous variable in which a person can identify anywhere along the <span id="ITerm520">continuum</span><span id="ITerm521"/><span id="ITerm522"/><span id="ITerm523"/><span id="ITerm524"/><span id="ITerm525"/><span id="ITerm526"/><span id="ITerm527"/><span id="ITerm528"/> of “feminine” and “masculine.” We define the term transgender broadly to be inclusive of any person whose gender identity does not match the gender that would correspond with their sex assigned at birth. Transgender individuals are more susceptible to EDs than cisgender individuals. Within the transgender community, 17.7% of individuals have elevated ED symptomatology, and individuals assigned female at birth are especially at risk for developing an ED during their lifetime (Rasmussen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Elevated ED symptoms may also intersect with gender dysphoria in transgender persons. For example, levels of body <span id="ITerm529">dissatisfaction</span><span id="ITerm530"/> are high among transgender individuals who believe that their body is too feminine (i.e., perception of having too large of breasts, hips, or proportion of body fat as compared to muscle) or too masculine (i.e., perception of having too much muscle mass and an undesired V-shaped torso) (Cusack et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). To influence their body weight or shape in a way that is more personally desirable, transgender individuals may engage in disordered eating and unhealthy exercise that could result in the development of an ED (Mirabella et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Gender-affirming treatments (e.g., hormone therapy, surgical interventions), therefore, may play a critical role in improving ED symptoms, but gender-affirming medical treatments are not sufficient stand-alone ED interventions (Rasmussen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par125"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Assessment Tip:</em> When <span id="ITerm531">working</span><span id="ITerm532"/><span id="ITerm533"/><span id="ITerm534"/><span id="ITerm535"/><span id="ITerm536"/><span id="ITerm537"/><span id="ITerm538"/><span id="ITerm539"/> with clients, it is critical to ask about their pronouns and to use these pronouns in every subsequent interaction. Finally, careful assessment of body image may be helpful in working with persons who identify as nonbinary or transgender, particularly to determine to what degree gender <span id="ITerm540"/><span id="ITerm541"/>dysphoria may influence the ED.</p></section>

In the United States, athletes were more likely to screen positive for an ED compared to non-athletes. Some research suggests that not all athletes are equally susceptible to developing an ED. For example, a meta-analytic review of ED psychopathology in female athletes vs. non-athletes found that athletes participating in weight class sports and sports emphasizing thinness/leanness (e.g., rowing, cross country, figure skating, etc.) had higher levels of disordered eating relative to other sport <span id="ITerm589">types</span><span id="ITerm590"/><span id="ITerm591"/><span id="ITerm592"/><span id="ITerm593"/><span id="ITerm594"/><span id="ITerm595"/><span id="ITerm596"/><span id="ITerm597"/> (e.g., volleyball, basketball; Chapa et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).

Athletes, especially athletes participating in sports that focus on thinness/leanness may be exposed to additional risk factors that non-athletes or athletes participating in other sports do not encounter; these additional risk factors include: (1) the belief that sport performance is optimal at a lower weight, (2) revealing uniforms, and (3) reinforcement from judges and/or coaches for certain body types. Due to the serious health risks associated with EDs (e.g., irregular heart rate, imbalanced electrolytes, bone deterioration), athletes who continue to participate in their sport with an ED are highly susceptible to physical injury, anemia, chronic <span id="ITerm600"/><span id="ITerm601"/><span id="ITerm602"/><span id="ITerm603"/><span id="ITerm604"/><span id="ITerm605"/><span id="ITerm606"/><span id="ITerm607"/><span id="ITerm608"/>fatigue, irregular menstruation (for women), and other serious medical problems due to relative energy deficiency <span id="ITerm609"/>syndrome (or REDs).</p><p class="Para" id="Par133">Identifying <span id="ITerm610">unhealthy</span><span id="ITerm611"/> exercise behaviors in athletes might be challenging because: (1) physical activity and sport participation are typically considered healthful behaviors and (2) athletes who exercise more than their coach recommends or when sick or injured may appear dedicated to their sport and/or team (and might even be rewarded). However, when patients engage in exercise past the point of their physical capacity, despite sickness or injury, against medical advice, or to compensate for an eating episode, it is unhealthful.
