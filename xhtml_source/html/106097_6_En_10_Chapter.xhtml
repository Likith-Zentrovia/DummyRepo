From witnessing unexpected death or injury to being subjected to violence (including sexual violence), the list of clinically definable traumatic events is non-closed. Almost a third of the world population, research shows, is also likely to experience several traumatic events (Benjet et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). While exposure to a clinically defined trauma is probable, multiple studies suggest that only a small, yet significant, part of those exposed will be at increased risk for developing <span id="ITerm1">posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</span> (Schein et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR72" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Moreover, those who don’t eventually meet the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD can still develop a partial, also called subsyndromal or subthreshold, presentation of PTSD. Despite not meeting the full criteria for PTSD, partial symptoms can significantly impair function and adversely affect quality of life, as it was found to be correlated with other mental health conditions, including <span id="ITerm2">depression</span>, substance use, and suicidality (Wallace et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR85" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><div class="Para" id="Par3">In addition to <span id="ITerm3">PTSD</span>, there are three other trauma and stress-related disorders for adults that are included in the Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders category of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). These include Acute Stress Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, and the newly added Prolonged Grief Disorder. Given the high likelihood of trauma exposure in the overall population, as well as exposure to distressing events or situations (even if they do not amount to DSM-5-TR clinically defined trauma), clinicians should be knowledgeable and skilled in diagnosing, assessing, and treating trauma and other stress-related disorders. This section will review each disorder’s core definitions, criteria, and prevalence.

Although the word “trauma” is derived from Latin and means “physical wound,” toward the end of the nineteenth century, the definition of the term was expanded to include “mental wounds” (Lasiuk &amp; Hegadoren, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). Studies also suggest various types of traumas ranging from individual-based trauma that influences the individual and their developmental trajectory to the collective trauma that impacts a whole group, for example, hate crimes against a minority (Scott et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR74" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">The clinical definition for <span id="ITerm5">trauma</span> is broad because it encompasses a myriad of responses to one-time events (e.g., car accident); prolonged or reoccurring events (e.g., military combat or domestic violence); exposure to multiple traumas, also referred to as complex trauma (e.g., childhood abuse or community violence); and collective trauma (e.g., a community destroyed by a disaster) (Courtois &amp; Gold, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). While traumatic stress can result from either natural (e.g., tsunami, hurricane, earthquake) or human-caused events (e.g., terrorism, industrial accident, interpersonal abuse), research shows that human-caused events of betrayal or interpersonal violence are more likely to elicit severe posttraumatic reactions than natural disasters that are accidental by nature (Voigt et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR84" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec4"><h4 class="Heading">The Definition of Stress</h4><p class="Para" id="Par6">Although sometimes used interchangeably, stress and stressors are not synonymous: Stress results from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors, whereas stressors are extrinsic environmental events or stimuli that can be perceived as positive or negative (Carter, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). Moreover, stress is a reaction to a <span id="ITerm6">stressor</span>. While excessive stress is part of the entirety of trauma and stress-related disorders described in this chapter, a stressor does not necessarily amount to the clinical definition of trauma. For example, the event of divorce, while even very distressing, is not considered a traumatic event per DSM-5-TR. However, it may be a stressor in the context of Adjustment Disorder.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec5"><h4 class="Heading">The Definition of Prolonged Grief</h4><p class="Para" id="Par7">The concept of grief as an <span id="ITerm7">emotional</span>, cognitive, and behavioral experience in response to loss has been heavily researched. From the early work of Kübler-Ross (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a></span>), who formalized and defined grief as stages (i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance), to more recent research by Prigerson et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>)<span id="ITerm8"/>, studies have shown that grief is an intense and painful, yet natural process. With sufficient internal and external resources and support, most people cope and readjust to life while recognizing their loss. When the symptoms of grief do not decrease, interfere with daily functioning, and persist for 12 months or more in response to the death of a close person, it is considered Prolonged Grief (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec6"><h4 class="Heading">Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par8">Frequently described as embodying “the invisible wounds of war,” PTSD is one of the more prevalent yet complex mental disorders. The recent publication of the DSM-5-TR (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) included no material <span id="ITerm9">changes</span> to PTSD as stipulated in DSM-5 (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>), aside from correcting a minor grammatical error of redundancy. However, the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD were significantly different from the criteria specified in the previous edition of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (4th ed. APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>; DSM-IV-TR). One major change was moving PTSD from the Anxiety Disorders chapter and placing it in a new chapter: Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). This change was warranted because while there is significant comorbidity between post-traumatic stress and anxiety, the two disorders are inherently different. While anxiety disorders can be derived intrinsically, exposure to an extrinsic traumatic event is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of PTSD. Additional changes included <span id="ITerm10">revision</span> and expansion of the trauma criterion (discussed below), adding three symptoms to the existing 17, and division of the existing avoidance cluster (Hoge et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">Criterion A defines <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">exposure to a traumatic event</em>. Not disregarding academic calls for the elimination of Criterion A altogether in the DSM-5, the subcommittee on PTSD eventually determined that exposure was an essential component of the PTSD construct (Friedman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Exposure was once defined in very general terms. With DSM-5 revisions, the definition of a traumatic event now specifically includes “sexual violence” in addition to actual or threatened death or serious <span id="ITerm11">injury</span>. DSM-IV-TR criteria included “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Still, considering the significant percentage (approximately 30%) of women diagnosed with PTSD as a result of sexual violence (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>), the inclusion of the term “sexual violence” was warranted. The revisions to Criterion A both expanded its meaning and provided more specificity. With DSM-5, an individual no longer has to personally experience or witness the traumatic event. Subsection 3 notes that exposure to a traumatic event includes “learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 301). However, the event must have been violent or accidental. In addition, repeated or extreme exposure to “aversive details of the violent act” as part of one’s employment or volunteer responsibilities, such as those experienced by first responders collecting human remains, crisis counselors listening to details of a traumatic event, or law enforcement working in sexual or violent crimes, are now also considered exposure. However, watching traumatic events via electronic media or TV that have no direct relation to the person watching (e.g., a family member or a close friend) is not deemed to be sufficient for meeting Criterion A, based on DSM-5-TR PTSD criteria (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). While the requirements included in subsections one through four of Criterion A are not exhaustive, they do provide structure and set expectations regarding what can be considered a traumatic event.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">Criterion (Cluster) B requires the <span id="ITerm12">presence</span> of at least one <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">intrusion</em> symptom out of three possibilities. The three intrusive symptoms include: (1) “Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 301), which apply only to distressing sensory recollection (e.g., specific sites, smells, touch, etc.) rather than abstract thoughts (Friedman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>); (2) “Recurrent <span id="ITerm13">distressing</span> dreams in which the content...are related to the traumatic event(s)” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 302), which includes both trauma-related <span id="ITerm14">dreams</span> or nightmares as well as replay of the traumatic event (Friedman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>); (3) “Dissociative reactions (e.g. flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 302), where flashbacks are in a continuum ranging from no awareness to total awareness; (4) “Intense or prolonged psychological distress...to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble...the traumatic event(s)” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 302). For example, a combat veteran who experiences psychological distress (anxiety, irritation, fear) when hearing July fourth fireworks; (5) “Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble...the traumatic event(s)” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 302). For example, a rape victim who was raped while walking by herself at night now experiences panic symptoms in the form of heart palpitations, sweaty palms, and tremors every time she needs to walk at night.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11"><span id="ITerm15">Criterion C</span> requires at least one <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">avoidance of stimuli</em> symptom associated with the traumatic event. Similar to Criterion B (intrusion), Criterion C (avoidance) has always been considered a core element of PTSD. Either (1) “Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s)” (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>, p. 302) or (2) Avoidance of external reminders, such as people, activities, places, etc. that arouse distressing experience in the form of memories, thoughts, or feelings associated with the traumatic event should be endorsed by the patient. The expression of avoidance can be through behavior, such as taking substances to lower distress around trauma-related memories, or through internal mechanisms, like dissociation, when triggered.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12"><span id="ITerm16"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Negative alterations</em></span> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">in mood and cognition</em>, as defined under Criterion D, are symptomatic of individuals with PTSD (Friedman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Two or more of the following seven criteria need to be met: (1) An inability to <span id="ITerm17">remember</span> an essential element of the traumatic event, usually in the form of dissociative amnesia. Derived from hysteria disorders in the nineteenth century, dissociative amnesia in trauma developed through the years without a specific definition. Nijenhuis and Van der Hart (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR01" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) defined dissociative amnesia in trauma as “a division of an individual’s personality, that is, of the dynamic, biopsychosocial system as a whole that determines his or her characteristic mental and behavioral actions” (p. 418). Geared toward surviving the trauma, an individual’s personality is reorganized into two or more dissociative parts that are kept separate and experience the world differently (Nijenjius &amp; Van der Hart, 2011). Trauma-caused dissociation is manifested through negative or positive symptoms. The former includes dissociative amnesia and loss of affect and will, while the latter includes dissociative flashbacks or the re-experiencing of the traumatic events (Nijenjius &amp; Van der Hart, 2011); (2) Alteration in cognition in the form of persistent and exaggerated negative perception about self, others, or the world (e.g., “I am bad”; or “People are dangerous”); (3) Alteration in cognition in the form of persistent and distorted negative perceptions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event (e.g., “If I hadn’t worn this dress the rape would not have happened”); (4) Persistently experiencing negative mood, such as sadness, fear, guilt or shame; (5) Diminished participation in significant activities (e.g. favorable, hobbies) in comparison to period prior to the <span id="ITerm18">trauma</span>; (6) Detachment or estrangement from others with whom the individual was close prior to the trauma; (7) “Numbing inability” (Friedman, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>, p. 551) in the form of an inability to experience positive emotions such as happiness or loving feelings (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par13"><span id="ITerm19">Criterion E</span> clusters symptoms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event</em>. Two or more of the following six symptoms must be met: (1) Irritability and anger outbursts in verbal or physical aggression toward others or objects. The behavior does not need to be triggered by provocation; (2) Reckless or self-destructive behavior, such as alcohol or substance use, non-protected/unsafe sexual relations, suicidal attempts, reckless driving, etc.; (3) Hypervigilance is manifested through <span id="ITerm20">maladaptive</span>, heightened sensitivity, and attentional bias toward cues of potential threats or dangers in the environment (Kimble et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR02" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>); (4) Exaggerated startle response in the form of increased physiological reactivity to events or thoughts associated with the trauma; (5) Problems with concentration, including short-term memory problems; (6) Difficulty sleeping in different forms (e.g., difficulty falling asleep or going back to sleep, etc.).</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Criterion F requires that Clusters B to E appear for more than 1 month after the traumatic event (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Late onset is also possible, whereby posttraumatic symptoms appear much later than 1 month requirement, at times years after the completion of the traumatic event. However, if PTSD symptoms are evident immediately and within a month following the trauma, another disorder, such as Acute Stress Disorder, should be considered.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">While it is essential to detect the relevant symptoms to establish a correct diagnosis, it is similarly important to identify how the symptoms interfere with an individual’s daily functioning. Criterion G requires the clinician to compare their client’s daily functioning before and after the traumatic event and determine whether these changes interfere with daily functioning. In making the comparison, the clinician should explore different areas of an individual’s life, such as work, family, social relationships, or engagement in pleasurable activities. In addition, the clinician should verify that the symptoms or disturbance in daily functioning are not due to any type of substance use or a medical condition that could better account for the symptoms and disruption in daily functioning. While this is a standard criterion that is included in almost all DSM-5-TR disorders, it is important to rule out the possibility that the <span id="ITerm21">symptoms</span> are the result of substance use because of the high comorbidity between alcohol or substance use and PTSD. Finally, depersonalization and derealization, subtypes of dissociation, may accompany PTSD symptoms and, if so, should be indicated as specifiers. Both depersonalization and derealization feature distortions in perception. Depersonalization is when an individual feels as if they are looking at themselves from the outside and are not in full control of how they perceive their feelings, thoughts, or body. Derealization is where an individual feels disconnected from the external world (e.g., dreamlike, distorted, or fake) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). These two subtypes of PTSD were first introduced in DSM-5 (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec7"><h4 class="Heading">Prevalence of PTSD</h4><p class="Para" id="Par16">As discussed above, a traumatic event is a prerequisite to developing PTSD. Although most people will experience at least one traumatic event during their lifetime (Benjet et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), exposure to most traumatic stressors will not result in PTSD. However, research suggests that interpersonal violence increases the likelihood of developing the disorder (Ellis &amp; Zaretsky, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). In comparison to a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or sexual violence is more likely to increase the risk for PTSD.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">Research examining the prevalence of <span id="ITerm22">PTSD</span> in the US population shows that only a small percentage of those who experience a traumatic stressor go on to develop PTSD. Kilpatrick et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>)<span id="ITerm23"/> found that approximately 8% of the population will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Other studies suggest slightly smaller or larger numbers. A systematic review of 41 studies that assessed for PTSD in over 7 million primary care patients in the US found that 12.5% of the sample, after factoring in various sub-groups such as military veterans and special-risk populations, met the criteria for PTSD (Spottswood et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR80" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). A recent literature review of 38 PTSD-focused studies in the US found point estimates of PTSD prevalence ranged from 8.0% to 56.7%, 1-year prevalence from 2.3% to 9.1%, and lifetime prevalence from 3.4% to 26.9% (Schein et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR72" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec8"><h4 class="Heading">Acute Stress Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par18">A diagnosis of <span id="ITerm24">acute stress disorder (ASD)</span> may help to identify individuals who are at increased risk for developing PTSD. However, most people who develop PTSD do not always meet ASD criteria (Bryant, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Criterion A of ASD is identical to Criterion A of PTSD. Although both disorders require some type of exposure to a traumatic event, there are key differences in required symptoms and their duration (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">10.1</a></span>). First, symptoms needed to make a PTSD diagnosis are listed in categories (i.e., B through E) with specific requirements regarding the number of symptoms needed for each (e.g., cluster B requires at least one symptom while cluster E requires at least two).</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">In contrast, criterion B for <span id="ITerm25">ASD</span> requires the presence of any nine symptoms out of the following five categories: intrusion, negative mood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and arousal symptoms. For ASD, the intrusion category provides several ways to note how the individual re-experiences the traumatic event: (B1) Reexperiencing the <span id="ITerm26">trauma</span> through unwanted, recurring, and intrusive memories of the traumatic event where the memories can be manifested through sensory, emotional, or physiological distress; (B2) Reexperiencing the trauma through recurring dreams related to the traumatic event that causes distress. For example, a victim of robbery could experience recurring nightmares about being assaulted; (B3) Reexperiencing the trauma through dissociative reactions (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Dissociative reactions, depersonalization, and derealization were discussed in detail in the PTSD section of this chapter.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">In the minutes and hours after a traumatic event, it is expected that those who have been exposed will be very distressed and think constantly about the trauma. To avoid pathologizing strong yet normal reactions, a diagnosis of <span id="ITerm27">ASD</span> is not made until at least 3 days after an event. Dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days that should be considered include (B4) Reexperiencing the trauma through intense or prolonged psychological (e.g., fear, sadness, shame) or physiological (e.g., panic symptoms) distress where the distress is triggered by internal or external cues that resemble those of the traumatic event. The negative mood category (B5) requires that the individual finds it impossible to experience a positive state of mind (e.g., intimacy for a sexual violence survivor) or has an unremitting negative mood (e.g., sadness, anger, shame) after the trauma. The dissociative symptoms category requires alterations in <span id="ITerm28">awareness</span> in the form of (B6) the presence of depersonalization or derealization or (B7) an inability to remember important aspects of the traumatic event (i.e., dissociative amnesia) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">The avoidance symptoms category can be divided into efforts to avoid internal and external stimuli associated with the traumatic event: (B8) Efforts to avoid internal stimuli include refusal to talk about memories about the traumatic event and share thoughts or feelings (e.g., refusing to use psychological treatment); (B9) Efforts to avoid external stimuli associated with the traumatic event include avoidance of going to places or meeting with people that remind the individual of the <span id="ITerm29">trauma</span> (e.g., using an elevator after experiencing an assault in an elevator). Individuals with Acute Stress Disorder experience heightened arousal in the form of (B10) Sleep disturbance in various forms (e.g., due to nightmares, difficulties sleeping, or waking up during the night with difficulties falling asleep); (B11) Anger outbursts or irritability (e.g., anger eruption with no apparent reason or a disproportionate reaction to a trigger)<span id="ITerm30"/>; (B12) Hypervigilance in the form of heightened sensitivity to potential threats, whether related or unrelated to the traumatic event; (B13) Concentration problems including difficulties attending to tasks that require focus or remembering daily events; (B14) Exaggerated startle in response to unexpected stimuli (e.g., jumpiness in response to loud sound) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Second, the duration of symptoms for each of the two disorders—PTSD and ASD—is different. For an ASD diagnosis, criterion C notes that symptoms need to be present for at least 2 days but no more than 1 month (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). If symptoms are present beyond 1 month, then a diagnosis of PTSD should be considered and evaluated.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">Similar to nearly all DSM-5-TR disorders, the symptoms are expected to result in significant distress or impairment in social, work, and family relationships (Criterion D). In addition, it is always necessary, under criterion E, to rule out other causes that could better explain the presence of symptoms, such as substance use, medical conditions, or psychological disturbances, such as brief psychotic disorder (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). While the DSM-5-TR views acute stress disorder as a precursor to PTSD and therefore appears alongside PTSD in the same section (trauma and stress-related disorders), the World Health Organization (WHO) has a different view of acute stress. The WHO’s 11 edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11, 2018) defines acute stress as a possible <span id="ITerm31">reaction</span> following a traumatic event. It is considered a “problem associated with harmful or traumatic events.” Moreover, the ICD-11 defines acute stress reaction as “normal given the severity of the stressor, and usually begins to subside within a few days after the event.”</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec9"><h4 class="Heading">Prevalence of Acute Stress Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par23">Research examining <span id="ITerm32">ASD</span> symptoms was initiated 3 days after the September 11th terrorist attacks. A national telephone survey conducted with 560 adults revealed that events reminding them of the attacks triggered anger (30%), repeated and disturbing memories, thoughts, or dreams associated with the attacks (16%), difficulties concentrating (14%), sleep-related problems (11%), and irritability or angry outbursts (9%) (Schuster et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>). Overall, 44% of respondents reported experiencing at least one or more symptoms of acute stress in the days following the attack. The study also found that 50% of women, compared to 37% of men, reported substantial stress reactions (Schuster et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">Recent studies that measured ASD’s prevalence can be differentiated by the specific type of <span id="ITerm33">trauma</span> the respective samples experienced. For example, human-caused violent acts increase the likelihood of ASD (Silver et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR77" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>). A 2017 systematic review that examined the prevalence of ASD among traffic accident survivors in eight countries found that almost 16% of the survivors experienced ASD. High rates of ASD were also found among terror attack survivors. <span id="ITerm34">Balasinorwala</span> and <span id="ITerm35">Shah</span> (2009) found that 30% of the 2008 Mumbai, India, terror attack victims who survived with injuries endorsed ASD symptoms. They further reported that experiencing physical injuries, being female, younger than 33 years of age, unmarried, unemployed, or low socioeconomic status increased the likelihood of experiencing ASD (Balasinorwala &amp; Shah, 2009). There are also instances where non-violent traumas, such as COVID-19 related, can also lead to increased rates of ASD (Mongodi et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec10"><h4 class="Heading">Adjustment Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par25"><span id="ITerm36">Adjustment disorder</span> criterion A requires exposure to a stressor. However, while the stressor must be identifiable, unlike acute stress disorder and PTSD, it does not need to be a traumatic event (e.g., exposure to actual death, threatened death, severe injury, or sexual violence). An infinite number of stressors meet the requirements of Criterion A, such as loss of employment, difficulty adjusting to college, or a move to a new city. In addition, the stressor can be experienced as a one-time (e.g., one-time divorce) or a continuing or recurring event (e.g., seasonal business crises). Moreover, the stressor can affect an individual, community, or country (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Symptoms are required to start within 3 months from the beginning of the stressor and end within 6 months from the termination of the stressor or its consequences. The following symptoms are required for meeting Criterion B: (B1) Marked distress that is disproportionate to the severity or intensity of the stressor while taking into account relevant cultural considerations that may impact symptom severity and presentation; (B2) The reaction to the stressor significantly impairs essential areas of functioning, whether family, social, occupational, or other. For example, 5 months after immigrating to the USA, a woman continues to isolate, avoids applying for jobs despite financial need, and experiences frequent anger outbursts toward her partner and family members.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">Similar to PTSD and acute stress disorder, the clinician should make sure that the adjustment disorder symptoms do not meet the criteria for another disorder that may take precedence, such as major depressive <span id="ITerm37">disorder</span> (Criterion C). The clinician should also try to identify whether there is any disorder that preceded the stressor (e.g., dysthymia) and whether current symptoms could be an exacerbation of a preexisting disorder. Criterion D requires that the clinician avoids confusing the presenting symptoms with normal bereavement. Criterion E sets a relatively brief time limit, up to 6 months from the termination of the stressor or its termination of the stressor’s consequences, for the presentation of symptoms. Other diagnoses should be considered if symptoms persist for longer than 6 months. The following specifiers can be used with adjustment disorder: depressed mood, anxiety, mixed anxiety, disturbance of conduct, mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, and unspecified (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). A new specifier for adjustment disorder was added in the DSM-5-TR, which defines adjustment as acute if symptoms have persisted for less than 6 months and as persistent (chronic) if symptoms have persisted for 6 months or longer following the termination of a stressor or its consequences (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec11"><h4 class="Heading">Prevalence of Adjustment Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par27">Relative to PTSD, there is a lack of research on adjustment disorder. It is likely that because of the relatively short span allowed for the disorder’s symptoms, there is less interest in its prevalence. Moreover, in comparison to both PTSD and ASD, the symptoms of adjustment disorder are nonspecific, <span id="ITerm38">vague</span>, and open to interpretation. For instance, following a divorce, one clinician may consider a highly distressed response as a part of normal grief over the change in familial circumstances. In contrast, another clinician may view it as marked distress that meets the criteria for adjustment disorder.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">The DSM-5-TR estimates that between 5% and 20% of individuals receiving outpatient mental health care are diagnosed with adjustment disorder (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Other research studies report similar findings. In recent years, adjustment disorder has been studied, particularly in the context of unexpected health-related <span id="ITerm39">events</span>. Such events require a physical adjustment of the body to a new situation and cognitive and emotional adjustment, which can be distressing. Among breast, prostate, and head and neck cancer patients in the Netherlands and in all stages and treatment modalities (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 200), the overall prevalence of adjustment disorder is estimated at 13.1% (Van Beek et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR83" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). High rates of adjustment disorder following the pandemic were also indicated in China.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec12"><h4 class="Heading">Prolonged Grief Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par29"><span id="ITerm40">Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD)</span> was added to the Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders in the DSM-5-TR (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). It was also integrated into the ICD-11. The intent behind the new addition was to define and help mental health providers identify a pattern of prolonged, persistent, and maladaptive grief response that may become dysfunctional and even dangerous to the mourner’s life, such as engaging in self-harming behaviors (Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). To separate persistent, chronic behavior from natural and expected mourning, Criterion A requires that at least 12 months pass from the time of the passing of a person who was close to the bereaved (for children and adolescents, at least 6 months). Criterion B provides that persistent grief response should be in the form of at least one of the two: intense yearning for the deceased or preoccupation with thoughts or memories of the deceased. These emotional and cognitive experiences are expected to occur most days—where, at the time of diagnosis, they have occurred nearly every day for at least the last month—and to a clinically significant degree (e.g., with high intensity). Criterion C provides eight additional symptoms, from which three need to take place most days and to a clinically significant degree since the death and nearly every day for at least the last month before diagnosis. These symptoms that occur <span id="ITerm41">following</span> and as a result of the death include (1) Identity disruption (i.e., not feeling like self since the death), (2) Marked sense of disbelief about the death, (3) Avoiding reminders that the person is dead, (4) Intense emotional pain (e.g., anger) related to the death, (5) Difficulty reintegrating back to relationships and activities (e.g. social-related activities), (6) Emotional numbness, (7) Feeling that life is meaningless, and (8) Intense sense of loneliness. Criterion D requires that the overall experience cause significant distress in main areas of life, such as social or occupational. In addition, the duration and severity of the bereavement should exceed expected social, cultural, or religious norms for the mourner (Criterion E), and alternative diagnoses that may explain the prolonged bereavement, such as Major Depressive Disorder or PTSD, have been considered and rejected (Criterion F).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec13"><h4 class="Heading">Prevalence of Prolonged Grief Disorder</h4><p class="Para" id="Par30">Given that <span id="ITerm42">PGD</span> is a new disorder in the DSM, there is a paucity of studies on prevalence in the general population. Existing studies suggest that natural causes of death are associated with a lower potential risk of PGD compared with unnatural causes (Gang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). A meta-analysis review of 14 studies with an adult population exposed to non-violent bereavement found a pooled prevalence of 9.8% of PGD (Lundorff et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to millions of deaths worldwide, also led to increased rates of PGD; a cross-sectional online survey in <span id="ITerm43">China</span> conducted between September and October 2020 among participants (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 422) who lost a close person due to COVID-19 found that between 29.3% and 37.8% screened positive for PGD, depending on the evaluation tool (Tang &amp; Xiang, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR82" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). In addition to the difference between natural and unnatural causes of death, factors such as shorter time since death, deaths of siblings and “others,” and deaths from accidents and homicides were positively associated with developing PGD (Gang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec14"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><p class="Para" id="Par32">A strong working alliance between the mental health professional and the client is necessary when assessing for mental health problems and working toward achieving correct diagnosis, as well as treatment goals. This is especially true when assessing for trauma-related disorders because the phenotype of PTSD is often confusing and difficult to identify, as it can be masked or exacerbated by other disorders such as traumatic brain injury, depression, substance use, or anxiety disorder. In addition, people may not realize they have PTSD because they view their symptoms as a sign that they are having difficulty coping (i.e., “there’s something wrong with me”) (Ellis &amp; Zaretsky, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">The foundation of a good therapeutic alliance is a collaborative relationship where an affective bond between the clinician and the client develops and facilitates the process of agreeing on and progressing with selected treatment goals (Lilienfeld et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>). To elicit good information, it is worthwhile taking the time to create a sense of safety so that the client feels comfortable sharing private details about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. To establish a therapeutic alliance, it is critical to express compassion, show a genuine interest in the client’s concerns, and engage the client as a collaborator in treatment. Client collaboration can be obtained through mutually setting goals for treatment and sharing impressions of the treatment and progress. Reviewing <span id="ITerm44">assessment</span> results with the client and providing psychoeducation have the potential to enhance the therapeutic alliance as it can assuage the client’s concerns about the source of their distress and their ability to cope and change. It is incumbent to continue gathering relevant information and monitoring progress at each stage of therapy.</p><div class="Para" id="Par34">An unstructured and flexible interview approach may provide useful information to start establishing a therapeutic alliance (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">10.2</a></span>).

However, any interviews with a third party should be done with the client’s informed consent. Because of the clinician’s primary legal and ethical responsibility to maintain the client’s confidentiality, obtaining a client’s verbal consent and securing a client-signed Release of Information (ROI) form is advisable.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">While interviews are the first step in forming a diagnosis, it is also essential to let the client actively participate in the evaluation process. Information from cognitive and mood assessments can inform case conceptualization and guide treatment planning if the client has given their best effort in responding and is forthcoming when completing measures. Self-report measures, where the client rates their distress levels and endorses the presence and magnitude of various symptoms, are psychology’s most widely used measurement tools (Haeffel &amp; Howard, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Indeed, there are a variety of trauma and stressor-related disorder self-report measures that can be used to identify the symptoms, rate their onset and severity, as well as monitor for any change in diagnosis throughout treatment. Some self-report measures can help the clinician and client monitor whether the treatment is effective.</p></section>

The most recent edition is the SCID-5 (First &amp; Williams, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), which contains 12 modules that mirror the DSM-5’s organizational structure. The five different versions of the SCID-5 include the research version (RV), clinician version (CV), clinical trial (CT), personality disorders (PD), and <span id="ITerm45">alternative model for personality disorders (AMPD)</span>. A user’s guide also accompanies each version. The SCID-5 trauma assessment includes an assessment of ASD and PTSD with timeline difference (i.e., whether trauma occurred in the past month of evaluation or more). The SCID-5 can also be used to evaluate for trauma or stressor-related disorders that don’t meet the criteria for PTSD, ASD, or adjustment disorder. A recent study that tested the psychometric properties of the SCID-5-Clinical Version (CV) found strong validity of 1.00 sensitivity, 0.96 specificity, and 0.80 Kappa Coefficient, as well as reliability (through test-retest interrater interview, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> = 139) of 0.84 Kappa Coefficient (Osório et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">The time to administer the SCID depends on the client’s personal history, relevant disorder, and other potential comorbid disorders or rule-outs that emerge during an initial interview. As such, administration of the SCID-5 may take between 30 min and 2 h. The SCID uses a combination of mandatory probes with a decision tree approach. The clinician is expected to use professional judgment and skip irrelevant questions or entire sections of the SCID if criteria have not been met for specific probes. Because the administration of the SCID involves decision-making, the person administering the SCID must be trained to conduct the interview.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec18"><h4 class="Heading">General Interview: The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview</h4><p class="Para" id="Par39">The <span id="ITerm46">Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)</span> is a brief structured diagnostic interview for major psychiatric disorders as defined in DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, as well as ICD-10 (Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>). The MINI was designed to assess 17 of the most common psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, mania and hypomania, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, substance use disorder, and more. Specifically developed to be brief, administration of the MINI takes approximately 15 min, which is significantly shorter than the SCID (Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>). In addition, the MINI was designed to be used by trained interviewers rather than physicians or mental health professionals (Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>). There are more than 15 versions of the MINI, each addressing a different disorder and different population (e.g., adults, children, clinician-rated or patient-version). The most appropriate module for PTSD appears to be the Standard MINI, which assesses all 17 disorders.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Psychometrically, the MINI is a sound instrument and aligned with both the SCID-IV and ICD-10 for all 17 disorders. Specifically, the PTSD module shows significant sensitivity (>0.70) and very good positive predictive value (>0.75). Research also shows that the MINI has excellent inter-rater reliability (Interrater Kapa = 0.95) and good test-retest reliability (Test/Retest Kappa = 0.73) (Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>). The measure has gained popularity among researchers worldwide and has been translated into multiple languages. This measure is useful for research purposes and as a supplemental measure of a more thorough interview, for diagnostic purposes.</p></section>

The CAPS is considered the gold standard of PTSD structured interviews. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item questionnaire (while the prior version included 17 items) that also measures, through a single score, each symptom’s severity based on its frequency and intensity (Blake et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>). There are currently three versions of CAPS-5: past month, worst month/past month, and past week.

In addition, because answering the CAPS-5 interview questions can be intense, mental health professionals are expected to complete a 4.5-h training before administering the measure. Training by the Veterans Affairs’ National PTSD Center can be found on their website. Often, it is helpful to supplement the CAPS-5 with a trauma-focused assessment like the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5), which measures the frequency and intensity of the client’s exposure to a range of traumatic events (see below for a description of the LEC-5).</p></section>

Designed as a flexible semi-structured interview, the PSSI requires familiarity with its manual and scoring process, knowledge of PTSD symptomatology, the ability to make a differential diagnosis, and sound professional judgment. During the administration of the interview, the clinician must determine which questions can be skipped. The PSSI-5 was developed to assist in diagnosing PTSD as well as provide an estimate of the severity of symptoms using a 5-point scale (from 0 = not at all to 4 = 6 or more times a week/severe). The PSSI has excellent psychometrics properties with strong internal consistency (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> = 0.89), test-retest reliability (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0.87), high interrater reliability for the total severity score (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.98), and good interrater agreement for PTSD diagnosis (Interrater Kappa = 0.84) (Foa et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).

Unlike the majority of PTSD assessments that assess for most recent or current events, the LEC-5 assesses for potentially traumatic events across the lifespan. The person is asked if the event happened to them, was witnessed, was learned about from others, or if they are not sure or the event does not apply. The LEC-5 was initially intended to be used co-jointly with the CAPS. In a study by Gray et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>), the LEC was validated as an independent measurement for trauma events. Concerning the LEC’s reliability, the study found that all items except for one achieved a kappa above 0.50. At the same time, the test-retest correlation was exceptionally high (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0.82). As for validity, the study found strong convergence between the LEC and the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ) scale, where only two of the nine items did not achieve a kappa of 0.40 (Gray et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). It is important to note that while the LEC is primarily useful for identifying traumatic events as defined by PTSD or acute stress disorder, it can also be used to assess the severity of symptoms for an adjustment disorder.</p></section>

It is a 20-item self-report measure used to screen for PTSD and to assess symptom severity. Respondents are asked to rate, on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), how bothered they have been by each of the 20 items that correspond with DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. The two versions of the PCL-5, one for civilian and the other for military, are available in two formats, including a version with Criterion A (trauma) and one without. The PCL-5 was not developed as a standalone screening tool. It can supplement other, more structured, clinician-rated assessments and is quick and easy for clients to complete. It is also useful for monitoring symptoms over time, as the client can easily provide a self-report every few sessions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Psychometric studies of the PCL prior to the DSM-5 version found the instrument to have high reliability and validity (Keen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>). Blevins et al.

Its two main goals are to differentiate between prolonged grief and bereavement-related depression and anxiety and to predict long-term functional impairments (Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>). The ICG includes 19 items that assess the frequency (i.e., from never to more than once daily) of experiences associated with grief, including “preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased, searching and yearning for the deceased, disbelief about the death, crying, being stunned by the death, and not accepting the death” (Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>). In addition, high ICG scores (i.e., higher than 25) were indicative of a greater likelihood to have an impairment in various aspects of life, from physical health to social functioning (Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>). The psychometric properties of the ICG are strong, with high internal consistency of the 19 items (Cronbach’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">α</em> = 0.94), test-retest reliability of 0.80, and concurrent validity with other tests of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0.67 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">r</em> = 0.87, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> &lt; 0.001.</p></section>

Jim has 12 years of education, as he dropped out of college to join the Marines. The family is living with Jim’s parents for financial reasons. Jim is currently unemployed. Six months ago, he lost his job as a carpenter for a construction company. He decided to attend therapy because his marriage was falling apart, and his wife was threatening to leave if he did not get help. The first session with his clinician was held with both Jim and Greta. During that session, Greta stated she was willing to stay in the marriage only if Jim agreed to receive ongoing mental health treatment. She described Jim as a “happy-go-lucky kind of guy in the past…, but now I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.” She also stated that unless Jim got help and changed his behavior, she would leave the marriage and take custody of their daughter. Greta added that Jim became increasingly angry and easily provoked from a “relatively calm and patient” person to one who lashed out “over nothing and anything.” She reported that Jim’s irritability and anger cost him his job.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">After the first session, Jim attended the following three sessions alone. The clinician learns Jim enlisted in the Marines at age 22, served for 6 years, and was deployed four times to Iraq. He shares that he engaged in multiple gunfire exchange battles during which several of his platoon service members were killed. On his last tour in Iraq, Jim was injured in an IED explosion. The Veterans Affairs recognized him to have 60% service-connected physical disability on account of permanent damage to his back and shoulders. Jim describes ongoing difficulty with his sleep manifested through waking up multiple times during the night. When pressed, Jim shares a recurring nightmare he has, where he is about to be shot by an enemy combatant from a close range. This recurring nightmare frequently interrupts Jim’s sleep as he wakes up with cold sweat and heart palpitations. Jim admits to being reluctant to talk about his experiences in Iraq with anyone, <span id="ITerm58">stating</span>, “It’s not going to do me any good...I have to be strong for my family and just move on...that is what a man supposed to do.” Jim is also frustrated about his “short fuse” with other people, including colleagues and family members, and discloses feeling guilty and ashamed of his behavior and anger outbursts in the aftermath: “But I don’t know how to stop it…I go from 0 to a-100 in about 2 s.” Jim also describes frustration when driving and engaging in “road rage” situations in the past over “assholes that shouldn’t be driving.” Because of his anger outbursts and feeling increasingly uncomfortable in social situations, Jim avoids going out and prefers to stay home. He also prefers to stay home as he is often “super-alert” in big social gatherings and experiences physical anxiety. Toward the end of the third session, Jim briefly adds that while at home, he enjoys drinking “my six-pack,” referring to beer, and playing video games.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Dayna: Mourning Her Partner</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par53">Dayna is 50 years old, Mexican American, gay, cisgender female.

She describes keeping Angela’s “side of the closet as it was…untouched.” She shares that often during work, she opens photo files on her computer and looks at photos of Angela “for hours on end.” She explains that looking at the pictures “brings back memories” and makes her feel “a little better…but then I remember Angela is not here and I just can’t believe it.” When asked about activities that provide some pleasure, Dayna notes, “Not much. I don’t have much patience for anything, and nothing makes me happy at this point because it doesn’t feel the same without Angela.” She is now going out with friends “only if they insist” and “don’t feel much of anything there… not interested in meeting anyone new.” She often spends a brief time at these events and heads back to her apartment.</p></div><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec28"><h3 class="Heading">Comment on Cases</h3><p class="Para" id="Par55">Both Jim and Dayna experienced an unexpected traumatic event: Jim in the form of risk to his own life, as well as the unexpected death of a service member in combat, and Dayna in the form of the unexpected death of her wife. Although both experienced a Criterion A event of PTSD, each person’s additional experiences are vastly different and, therefore, can draw a potentially different diagnosis. Jim’s experiences focus on intrusive thoughts in the form of nightmares, changes in mood and cognition in the form of guilt and shame, and hypervigilance in the form of anger outbursts. Jim’s use of alcohol may also suggest a comorbid diagnosis of alcohol use, a condition that is often correlated with PTSD and indicative of avoidant behavior. The symptoms that Dayna experiences are primarily reflective of enduring grief around the loss of a person, from frequently thinking of her late wife to engaging in activities that trigger memories (e.g., looking at photos) or <span id="ITerm60">maintaining</span> her clothes in the closet—these behaviors indicating avoidance and denial of her wife’s passing. Suicidal ideation or wishing to be dead should also be considered as a comorbid condition resulting from the traumatic experience and as a way of coping with the suffering.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec29"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Culture, Gender, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par56">Culture informs the psychological processes of both evaluation and treatment. It is an imperative factor that should be considered by the clinician from the diagnostic phase and throughout treatment. The perception of culture usually refers to race or gender. However, culture can be defined around common themes such as age, religion, social standing, education, financial resources, or veterans’ <span id="ITerm61">status</span>. Culture is complex and multi-faceted. For example, an individual may define herself as Hispanic, female, veteran, and Catholic. She belongs to multiple cultural groups rather than just one. Multiple cultural identities may play a significant role in an individual’s comprehension, understanding, and presentation of their mental health symptoms, as well as influence the treatment process and outcomes. Mental health professionals are responsible for being knowledgeable and sensitive to cultural considerations and their potential impact on assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment. Cultural competency is especially relevant when providing treatment for trauma-related disorders: while the self-cognition (e.g., “who I am”) of individuals from independent cultures (e.g., the USA or Europe) who experienced trauma is significantly defined by the trauma, it is much less so for individuals who experienced trauma from interdependent cultures (e.g., South America or Southeast Asia) (Maercker &amp; Horn, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR51" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>.). These findings are both theoretically and clinically significant. Theoretically, the findings highlight how social norms influence the perception of trauma. Clinically, the findings bolster the existing recommendation that mental health professionals strive to be culturally competent (i.e., knowledge, skills, and attitude).</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec30"><h3 class="Heading">Gender and Age</h3><p class="Para" id="Par57">Ample research suggests a positive correlation between gender, age, and posttraumatic symptoms. A meta-analysis of 77 studies revealed that both the risk of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">experiencing</em> traumatic events as well as endorsing PTSD symptomatology was significantly associated with being female, younger, and lower social class status (Brewin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>). A study by Ditlevsen and Elklit (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>) supported these findings in a sample of 6548 Nordic people using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-Part IV (HTQ-IV). The study found that 27.5% of women and 13.8% of men endorsed PTSD symptoms (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">There is research that also indicates that PTSD is likely to have different developmental trajectories for men and women (Ditlevsen &amp; Elklit, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>; Reynolds et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR65" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).

One possible explanation is that minorities are more resilient in the face of traumatic exposure (Mclaughlin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR52" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>). Data from a structured diagnostic interview administered to 34,653 adults revealed that minorities reported lower exposure to traumatic events in comparison to Whites (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). However, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD was found to be highest among African Americans (8.7%) in comparison to Whites and Hispanics (7.4% and 7.0%, respectively) and lowest among Asians (4.0%) (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). The relatively high prevalence of lifetime PTSD among African Americans may be explained by factors such as discrimination, racial stigmatization, and racial-based abuse, as well as lower socio-economic conditions (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). While African Americans are at greater risk for developing PTSD than Whites or other minorities, they are less likely to seek and receive mental health treatment for their trauma. Only 35.3% of Blacks with PTSD symptoms sought any type of treatment (e.g., physician or psychologist) versus 53.3% of Whites with similar symptomology (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). Also, only 42% of Hispanics and 32.7% of Asians sought any form of treatment for the disorder. The comparatively low percentage of minorities using mental health treatment for their PTSD symptoms can be explained by several factors, such as negative mental health stigma, cultural beliefs, poor quality or limited availability of resources, and racism or bias in treatment settings (Conner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">A significant negative association between stigma and mental health treatment was also found among American Middle Eastern (i.e., Arab or Israeli) individuals (Clement et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). Additional explanations, other than stigma, for a lower percentage of treatment-seeking and use among minorities can be attributed to socio-economic issues (e.g., health insurance plan with coverage for adequate mental health treatment) and knowledge (e.g., education about the options available).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec32"><h3 class="Heading">Sexual Minority Adults</h3><p class="Para" id="Par61">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) people living in the USA are more likely to encounter sexual abuse, crime, verbal harassment, and various types of discrimination in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts (Herek, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>; Rothman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR03" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). The higher <span id="ITerm62">likelihood</span> of victimization explains why sexual minorities also have a higher risk for PTSD (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). In an extensive study of 34,653 noninstitutionalized adults living in the USA, Roberts et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>) found that the PTSD prevalence among (self-defined) gay and bisexual men who were exposed to a potentially traumatic event was 13.38% and 9%, respectively, in comparison to 5.03% among heterosexual men with no same-sex attractions or partners. The study also found that PTSD prevalence among lesbian and bisexual women was 18.04% and 25.68%, in contrast to 12.50% among heterosexual women without same-sex attractions (Roberts et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). These differences in rates for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people are consistent with findings reported by earlier studies (Gilman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>; Herek et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Transgender individuals are disproportionately impacted both by exposure to trauma and the higher prevalence of PTSD. A study by Reisner et al. (2016) among 412 transgender adults found the mean number of discrimination attributions endorsed was 4.6. The most common reasons for discrimination were gender identity and expression (83%), masculine and feminine appearance (79%), and sexual orientation (68%). In addition, the study found that it is the combination of higher everyday discrimination and more significant reasons for discrimination experiences that were independently correlated with PTSD symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">Mental health professionals should be aware that new patients may be reluctant to disclose their sexual orientation for a variety of <span id="ITerm63">reasons</span>. Research found that only a third (33%) of gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans who used Veterans Health Care Administration (VHA) services were willing to disclose personal information about their sexual orientation (Simpson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR78" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). The study also found that a significant number of the sample avoided using at least one (25%) or two or more (15.4%) VHA services due to fear of stigmatization (Simpson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR78" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec33"><h3 class="Heading">The Armed Forces</h3><p class="Para" id="Par64">PTSD and other trauma-related disorders have been extensively studied among military service members and veterans returning from war. Violent combat exposure has been associated with severe mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress, depression, substance use, and risk for death by suicide (Boscarino, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>; Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>). US military <span id="ITerm64">Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)</span> and <span id="ITerm65">Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)</span> research examining the prevalence of PTSD among service members and veterans post-deployment found a strong positive correlation between participation in battle and PTSD (Ramchand et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">A meta-analysis of 22 studies examining PTSD and other trauma-related disorders among service members returning from OEF and OIF found significant variability in rates for PTSD (Ramchand et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>), ranging from a high of 60% among Army National Guard soldiers serving in Iraq (Stecker et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR81" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>) to a low of 1.6% among Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan (Larson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>). While the prevalence of PTSD varied among the studies, there were additional studies where service members completed Department of Defense (DoD) Post Deployment Health Assessment questionnaires within 2 weeks of returning home from service in Iraq. These studies estimated that PTSD rates were approximately 10% (Hoge et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>; Milliken et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR53" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). However, Ramchand et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>) also reported that reassessment of the same participants 6 months after their return from Iraq showed higher PTSD rates. Possible explanations for this increase could be the underreporting of symptoms or the gradual development of symptoms when reintegrating into society (Ramchand et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par66">Studies have also found a positive correlation between trauma and health-related problems among veterans. Specifically, chronic PTSD was associated with heart disease, as well as with an increased risk of developing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Boscarino, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>). To summarize, while PTSD and trauma-related disorders are extensively studied among service members and veterans, there is still a lot more to learn. Although different studies often produce different or conflicting results, sometimes due to the use of different measures, the sample studied, or the duration of the study (e.g., single or multiple time points), it is evident that service members and veterans are at higher risk for PTSD than the civilian population.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec34"><h3 class="Heading">Integrating Cultural Considerations into Case Conceptualization</h3><p class="Para" id="Par67">Cultural awareness should be a standard part of clinical practice. Learning about your client’s race, ethnicity, primary language, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, and military service is necessary for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Familiarity with recent research concerning the client’s culture and potential idioms of distress is also recommended. The client’s sex and gender can influence the reporting of symptoms. For example, a study found that men who worked in high-stress jobs, such as firefighters, tend to under-report symptoms of trauma (Skeffington et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR79" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par68">Similarly, women <span id="ITerm66">refugees</span> of Southeast Asian descent were likely to under-report symptoms of trauma resulting from rape because of stigma and shame (Kroll et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a></span>). The DSM-IV was the first to introduce the Outline for Cultural Formulation (OCF) to help clinicians organize and integrate cultural considerations of their clients into case formulation (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). The OCF was revised into a semi-structured interview format and included in the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation of Diagnosis (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). The purpose of the CFD is to operationalize the process of cultural considerations as part of the case formulation (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). More psychometrically sound assessment tools are needed to detect cultural considerations that should be integrated into diagnosis and treatment.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec35"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec36"><h3 class="Heading">Comorbid Disorders</h3><p class="Para" id="Par69">When evaluating a client for a <span id="ITerm67">PTSD</span> diagnosis, it is often the case that symptoms stemming from other disorders are also endorsed (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>). Disorders that occur conjointly with PTSD are known as comorbid disorders. Comorbid disorders may start before the onset of PTSD symptoms, appear concurrently, or after PTSD symptoms are evident. Multiple studies have identified several disorders that are likely to appear comorbidly with PTSD, either as a primary or secondary disorder (Courtois &amp; Gold, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>; Perkonigg et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR59" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>). A landmark study by Breslau et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a></span>) identified the rates of PTSD-comorbid disorders as agoraphobia (21.5%), drug abuse or dependence (21.5%), alcohol abuse or dependence (31.2%), major depression (36.6%), and any substance abuse or dependence (43.0%). Notably, being diagnosed with PTSD significantly increases the likelihood (82.8%) of being diagnosed with a second disorder (Brady et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>; Breslau et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a></span>). Other studies have reported similar findings (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>; Perkonigg et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR59" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par70">Research also suggests that <span id="ITerm68">there</span> is a significant positive correlation between PTSD and suicide. Sareen et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR71" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>) found that 20% of the study participants who were diagnosed with PTSD also endorsed suicidal ideation, and 6.5% reported that they had attempted suicide during the past year.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec37"><h3 class="Heading">Disorders That Mask PTSD Symptoms</h3><p class="Para" id="Par71">A disorder that shares similar symptomatology with PTSD (e.g., substance abuse, depression) could mask the presence of <span id="ITerm69">PTSD</span> (Ellis &amp; Zaretsky, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Symptoms that are masked can result in an incorrect or partial diagnosis of PTSD and lead to the use of the wrong pharmacological or psychological treatment. When making a differential diagnosis, Wilson and Keane (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR87" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>) recommend considering (1) Premorbidity (i.e., review the client’s psychiatric history to determine the presence of a preexisting disorder) (2) Possible history of substance use before or after the traumatic event; (3) Specific changes in personality and behavior before or after the traumatic event; (4) Type of interaction between premorbid disorder, traumatic event, and PTSD—to better understand how the premorbid condition could influence the presentation of PTSD symptoms; and (5) Need for multiple diagnoses, when warranted, if necessary as PTSD can coexist with other disorders.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec38"><h3 class="Heading">Emerging Issues: Complex PTSD, Race-Based Trauma, and Moral Injury</h3><p class="Para" id="Par72">Complex <span id="ITerm70">PTSD</span> is defined as “exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g., torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse)” (ICD-11, 2018). While the term is not formally acknowledged as a disorder in the DSM-5-TR, it is officially included in ICD-11 as a disorder. Because of the trauma’s unique characteristics, there is also a growing body of research evaluating psychotherapies for effectiveness in treating complex PTSD (Cloitre et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>; Courtois &amp; Gold, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par73">Racial trauma, or race-based traumatic stress, is a unique form of stress where “negative race-based encounters can lead to extreme levels of stress and thus…the potential to produce traumatic reactions” (Carter et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>, p. 1). A study by Carter et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>) evaluated the relationship between racial trauma and <span id="ITerm71">PTSD</span> and found a strong association, including symptoms of dissociation, changes in mood, sexual problems, and sleep disturbance.</p><p class="Para" id="Par74">Moral injury describes psychological distress that is experienced by an individual and results from an event where one’s actions are not aligned with one’s morals. Shay (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>) defined moral injury as (a) “A betrayal of what’s right; (b) By someone who holds legitimate authority (e.g., commander in the military); (c) In a high stakes situation” (p. 183). Moral injury is not yet included in the DSM, possibly because its’ specific symptoms (i.e., the individual experiencing distress, the severity of distress) must be clarified. Moreover, some have questioned whether there is a substantial difference between a moral injury that is not captured by PTSD symptom criteria, other stress-related disorders, or even depression. However, it is possible that treatments that may work for PTSD (e.g., exposure therapy) or depression (e.g., psychodynamic therapy) may not be effective with moral injury (Litz et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). While PTSD without additional issues such as impulsivity or substance use does not significantly increase the risk for harm to self (i.e., suicide) or harm to others (i.e., homicidally), moral injury has been shown to increase the risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Shay, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec39"><h3 class="Heading">Malingering</h3><p class="Para" id="Par75">The definition of malingering in the context of trauma-related disorders refers to “the intentional <span id="ITerm72">exaggeration</span> or production of feigned physical or psychological symptoms of PTSD to obtain some external reward (i.e., avoiding criminal responsibility, compensation, attention” (Peace &amp; Masliuk, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). Studies suggest that malingering or exaggeration of PTSD symptoms by veterans is more likely when disability compensation is involved (Freeman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>; Richardson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). The possibility of malingering reinforces the importance of administering a structured interview, along with other relevant evidence-based assessments that measure exaggeration and can serve to corroborate the presence of symptoms, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2). Some consider malingering a maladaptive call for help. People who are feigning or exaggerating symptoms are likely feeling psychologically, financially, and socially distressed and would benefit from treatment to help manage their concerns and promote adaptive coping.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec40"><h2 class="Heading">Dos and Don’ts</h2><p class="Para" id="Par76">DO develop a therapeutic alliance, a relationship built on trust and safety that is used for the client’s benefit. The clinician’s efforts to build that relationship should take place during the first session and continue throughout treatment.

During the interview, conduct an informal mini mental status exam by being attuned to verbal descriptions, non-verbal body and facial expressions, motor activity, affect, and level of collaboration.</p><p class="Para" id="Par78">DO explain the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment process to the client before you begin therapy. Providing informed consent at the start of therapy can help alleviate the client’s fears by addressing concerns and setting <span id="ITerm73">expectations</span>. It is also essential to “check in” with the client throughout the intake and diagnosis process to see if they have questions or clarification.</p><p class="Para" id="Par79">DO explore cultural considerations by reading relevant research and by consulting with experienced clinicians.

Scientifically supported assessments and therapies have shown high success rates (Norcross &amp; Wampold, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). A description of evidence-based therapies for DSM-5 disorders can be found on the American Psychological Association’s Division 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology) website.</p><p class="Para" id="Par81">DO inquire about past and present substance use as research shows very high comorbidity between PTSD and substance abuse. When inquiring about substance use, it is useful to learn about the type, frequency, amount, and duration of substance(s) used.</p><p class="Para" id="Par82">DO always inquire about past and present suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan, or intent, as research shows a significant positive correlation between <span id="ITerm74">PTSD</span> symptoms and suicide (Boscarino, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>; Prigerson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a></span>; Sareen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR71" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a></span>). Should the client endorse suicidal ideation, proceed by exploring whether such ideation is passive (e.g., wishing to disappear) or active (e.g., “I want to kill myself”). If active ideation is present, ask if there is a specific plan in place (e.g., use of a gun, medication overdose) and the seriousness and lethality of the intention (e.g., highly unlikely to highly likely). As appropriate, collaboratively develop a plan for the client to remain safe (i.e., a suicide safety plan). Consult with an experienced colleague regarding your risk assessment and the safety plan’s adequacy. If needed, discuss hospitalization.</p><p class="Para" id="Par83">DON’T rush the client into revealing the details of their trauma during the initial stages of therapy. While a diagnosis of PTSD or ASD requires that specific factors about a traumatic event are established for meeting Criterion A, consider discussing the traumatic event but be attuned to the dynamics in the room. Does the client independently and voluntarily share any of the details about their traumatic event? If not, it may be preferable to obtain the necessary details once treatment commences, when the therapeutic alliance is better established.</p><p class="Para" id="Par84">DON’T assume that exposure to a traumatic event always results in PTSD. Remember that most of the population is exposed to some type of trauma but most do not develop PTSD. In addition, consider whether Prolonged Grief Disorder could better explain the symptoms than PTSD in relevant situations. Such consideration is essential because it may impact the type of therapy you use with the client.</p><p class="Para" id="Par85">DON’T avoid making a comorbid diagnosis when warranted. Because of the high prevalence of PTSD with mood disorders, it is essential to ascertain if the client has symptoms of a mood disorder. If yes, it is important to identify the severity of the symptoms using appropriately normed, evidence-based <span id="ITerm75">assessments</span>. The diagnosis would inform case conceptualization and influence the type of therapy selected.</p><p class="Para" id="Par86">DON’T follow pseudo-science or use non-substantiated techniques when treating PTSD. Use a well-established evidence-based treatment such as Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PET), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Read about each modality and use the best one for your client.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec41"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par87">Moving the various trauma and stress-related disorders into a chapter of their own in the DSM-5 was a significant step indicating that the etiology of these disorders was stress rather than mood. Moreover, adding Prolonged Grief Disorder recently to the DSM-5-TR suggests that the Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders chapter on the DSM is still developing and evolving. The distress resulting from both traumatic experiences and other stressors reflects a way of processing the trauma, albeit in a dysfunctional way. Trauma and stress-related disorders are complex, multi-faceted, and often more challenging to diagnose than depression or anxiety. Different people can endorse completely different symptoms (e.g., hyperarousal versus avoidance, anger versus shame) and experience different comorbid disorders (e.g., depression versus substance use) and still meet DSM-5 criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. In the past two decades, we have witnessed a growing body of research on scientifically supported psychotherapies for PTSD, such as EMDR, PET, and CPT. These psychotherapies are now considered first-line treatments for PTSD. However, we are also seeing the emergence of a new, exciting, and promising body of research in the form of psychedelic-assisted therapy for PTSD (e.g., MDMA-assisted therapy). The diagnosis and treatment of such disorders require well-trained and skilled mental health clinicians who possess working knowledge about trauma disorders and use evidence-based practices.</p></section>
