Otherwise known as Cartesian dualistic thinking, scientists viewed the mind and body as separate. In time, healthcare systems have come to appreciate the role of psychologists and psychology in the transformation to provide patient-centered, holistic care with an intersectional lens. This transformation in thinking is called the biopsychosocial model, which includes integrating the individual’s biological and psychological well-being while considering their social environment. These are efforts to treat the whole person, with the understanding that there are, in fact, strong interactions between a person’s mind, body, and identities, all of which may contribute to and impact the individual’s presenting problem.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3"><span id="ITerm4">Psychology professionals</span><span id="ITerm5"/> can be found in a multitude of healthcare settings. Some care delivery systems include inpatient and outpatient hospital settings, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, surgery facilities, community clinics, and home care. A variety of programs are embedded within these settings, including primary care, behavioral medicine, hospice, and palliative care, to name a few. APA’s Guidelines for Psychological Practice in Health Care Delivery Systems (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>) highlights that the role of psychologists within health care delivery systems is crucial within multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams to promote the health and wellness of individuals who receive care in these systems.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Psychologists are integral to the more extensive medical and complex healthcare systems. In these settings, <span id="ITerm6">psychology professionals</span><span id="ITerm7"/> continue to provide traditional services such as psychological treatment and brief and extensive psychological and cognitive assessments. Due to the nuances of the healthcare systems and the individuals receiving care, the psychologists’ role extends to working with the individuals receiving care and their families. It also encapsulates triage and crisis management, promoting positive health behavior changes and maintenance, providing consultations to other healthcare professionals, and connecting individuals with additional resources outside the care system.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading">Description of the Population: Healthcare Settings and Population Characteristics</h2><p class="Para" id="Par5">There are several healthcare delivery systems in the United States that aim to provide preventative care to help individuals maintain health, provide resources, educate them on treatment options, and deliver treatments when an injury, disease, or illness develops (IOM, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>). Healthcare systems typically involve the facilities where care is delivered (i.e., hospitals, residential and home care services), long-term care, clinics, and offices, as well as the individuals providing care (i.e., physicians, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists).</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Healthcare Settings</h3><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar1"><div class="Heading">Short-Term Care Settings</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par6">These <span id="ITerm8">can</span> include inpatient psychiatric, emergency, and acute care departments, the treatment duration of which may involve a shorter turnaround from admission to discharge. A unique feature of emergency care departments is their ability to provide acute medical care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay or demographic characteristics (Fields et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>). Psychologists in this setting must be flexible in their treatment and consider the best approach <span id="ITerm9">to </span>care. Garcini et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) <span id="ITerm10">provide </span>a case study of an undocumented Latinx individual and the psychologist’s role as part of the integrated medical team assisting in the treatment and care provided to the individual. This chapter highlights how psychologists are critical in short-term care settings. Psychologists facilitate access to mental health treatment, reduce mental health stigma, underscore the impact on health outcomes through psychoeducation of the relationship between physical and mental health on overall health and disease processes, address communication between the healthcare consumer and the <span id="ITerm11">healthcare</span> professionals, and address the health needs of diverse healthcare consumers.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Long-Term Care Settings (LTC)</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par7"><span id="ITerm12">LTC</span><span id="ITerm13"/> facilities provide care to individuals with chronic and complex medical problems that have caused barriers to their ability to engage in activities of daily living. <span id="ITerm14">Skilled nursing facilities (SNF)</span> and Department of Veterans Affairs community living centers (CLC) are long-term care facilities. The population characteristics of individuals receiving treatment in this setting tend to range in age, with older adults being the highest consumers due to increased longevity. At the same time, younger individuals diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, disabilities, and chronic medical and psychological conditions make up the fastest-growing segment (Molinari et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Psychologists’ roles in <span id="ITerm15">LTC</span><span id="ITerm16"/> have changed drastically from the past in a limited consultation role. In addition to traditional face-to-face therapy, psychologists engage with the residents’ complete medical records, engage with additional healthcare staff, provide feedback, and make themselves available to the team and caregivers of the residents. In LTC settings, psychological and behavioral problems arise, and a psychologist can also provide an assessment and interventions based on their observations and staff reporting. Tailored behavioral interventions and alternate engagement reduce the reliance on psychotropic medications while promoting the health and well-being of both <span id="ITerm17">the</span><span id="ITerm18"/> residents and staff.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar3"><div class="Heading">Other Residential and Home Settings</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par8">An <span id="ITerm19">assisted living facility (ALF)</span><span id="ITerm20"/> may involve minimal primary care on-site. Individuals may still independently care for themselves and receive assistance from community programs to facilitate aging in the home. In some instances, individuals may no longer have access to traditional primary care facilities due to progressing chronic medical conditions, reduced social support networks, and increased burden in traveling to traditional care facilities, as is the case for most rural-dwelling individuals. Individuals in these <span id="ITerm21">settings</span> tend to be older and have complex medical conditions that also exacerbate mental health conditions or increase the risk for psychological disorders (Crawford et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Psychologists in these settings encompass the roles in previously mentioned settings, including team-based interaction, in providing wrap-around care to the individual. A unique aspect is the additional data obtained from an in-home visit. During an in-home visit, professionals obtain additional data, observe instances of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and, if appropriate, include the <span id="ITerm22">individual’s</span> caregivers in their treatment.</p></div></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Approaches to Care</h3><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar4"><div class="Heading">Interdisciplinary Care</div><div class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par9"><span id="ITerm23">Interdisciplinary</span> approaches involve various disciplines working on the same treatment goals and care. For example, in a Home-Based Primary Care setting, various disciplines, such as nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dieticians, psychologists, and social workers, all work together to create treatment goals for their patients. A patient may desire to go out to eat with their partner but have limited mobility, multiple medications, and anxiety surrounding the situation. On an interdisciplinary team, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nursing may converse with psychology on the functional and medical abilities of the individual and how those may interact with their anxiety and realistic means of obtaining their goal of taking their partner out to eat. These disciplines interconnect in efforts to collaborate and meet the patient’s goal. Thus, it is an <span id="ITerm24">interdisciplinary</span> team approach (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">20.1</a></span>, Interdisciplinary care model).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_20_Chapter/106097_6_En_20_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:27.5em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 20.1</span><p class="SimplePara">An interdisciplinary care <span id="ITerm25">model</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar5"><div class="Heading">Multidisciplinary Care</div><div class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm26">Multidisciplinary</span> approaches to care, like interdisciplinary, involve various professions; however, they may have multiple independent goals that vary while working unassisted by one another. For example, an acute care setting may have multiple specialties, such as pulmonology, cardiology, mental health, physical therapy, etc. These professions may share the same patient, but they strive to assist them with different goals and most commonly work independently of one another, though they may communicate (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">20.2</a></span>, Multidisciplinary care model).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_20_Chapter/106097_6_En_20_Fig2_HTML.png" style="width:34.5em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 20.2</span><p class="SimplePara">A multidisciplinary care <span id="ITerm27">model</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar6"><div class="Heading">Functional Care</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par11">In a clinic or <span id="ITerm28">setting</span> where functional care is the priority, psychologists may target a specific problem with the patient in more short-term care rather than tending to a comprehensive, longer-term holistic approach. The approach should still be intersectional, incorporating the patient’s identity into conceptualization. For example, in primary care outpatient settings, a patient who is an older adult female may express interest in working on one specific problem, such as diminished energy. The psychologist may ask the patient about their primary source of stress and target the problem from a functional perspective rather than doing a holistic, comprehensive intake, for example, helping a patient identify that sleep is an actionable target problem for diminished energy. The psychologist can introduce a short course of <span id="ITerm29">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)</span>. During the intake, the clinician may find that the individual needs to have more accurate ideas about sleep and aging, such that older adults naturally sleep less and nap more, which is not necessarily the case. Functionally, the clinician can underscore this as a misperception <span id="ITerm30">right</span> away and then introduce CBT-I as the mode of therapy.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1" id="FPar7"><div class="Heading">Holistic Care</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par12">In a clinic or <span id="ITerm31">setting</span> in which <span id="ITerm32">holistic care</span> is the primary approach, a psychologist may spend more time understanding the patient’s history, current functioning, and needs. Though they may still target specific treatment goals, holistic approaches utilize the biopsychosocial model of care and an intersectional lens more heavily. For example, using the same patient from the paragraph above, the psychologist would conduct a comprehensive intake that, in addition to sleep, may focus on additional behaviors, lifestyle, identity, and medical and mental health history contributing to the diminished energy. While the clinician may be aware that the patient holds misperceptions, they may wait to introduce these concepts until later in treatment, after building rapport and assessing all relevant factors.</p></div></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><p class="Para" id="Par13">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">referral source and question or consult</em> begins our journey as to what involvement psychology will have. A <span id="ITerm33">psychologist</span> may need to clarify the referral or consult question. A good practice includes speaking directly with the referring professional (e.g., primary care physician, psychiatrist, etc.) to understand their concerns and the context of the referral. A psychologist must ensure the referral question is specific, with a clear purpose and rationale. Sometimes referrals may read as “Patient refuses to adhere to recommendations and will not take medications. Psychology requested for capacity evaluation.” In this example, psychology may provide consultation on providing staff with tools to navigate challenging behaviors, assessing the underlying purpose of demonstrated behaviors, and providing an assessment for cognitive abilities, capacity, or both. A psychologist can confirm with the referrer what they hope to achieve with the referral. Clarification can help align the assessment or consultation with their expectations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">chart review</em><span id="ITerm34"/> is the best place to start when a referral or consultation for psychology services is requested. It is beneficial when the psychologist is not an integrated member of the individual’s care team and may need immediate access to the referral source to clarify the referral question. The health record contains valuable information, including demographic information, social history, past and present medical history, hospitalization history, medications, and past mental health engagement. Additionally, medical care professionals’ notes may contain descriptions of interpersonal interactions, treatment compliance history, personality, mental and cognitive functioning, and safety alerts.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Collateral information</em> <span id="ITerm35"/>may also be available from the healthcare team professionals and individuals ‘support systems, such as caregivers, friends, and family. Regarding the latter, psychologists should be aware of documentation through a signed release, a healthcare activation note indicating a medical proxy is the point of contact, or through a healthcare power of attorney documented in the chart. Psychologists working within an organization like a hospital or community clinic may not need an additional release to speak with the individual’s healthcare team. The psychologist should know the organization’s structure to verify the protocol. Collecting collateral observations helps to clarify the referral question and to prepare the psychologist for the clinical interview. In some cases, the collateral contact may be the final source of information gathered, especially if the individual cannot <span id="ITerm36">participate</span> in the clinical interview. Situations where the individual cannot communicate effectively on their own include severe mental health crisis, impaired cognitive functioning due to delirium, dementia, or brain injuries, substance intoxication or withdrawal, and physical illness or fatigue.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">clinical interview</em> is the most essential tool for the psychologist. In most instances, the initial encounter with the individual sets the tone for the therapeutic relationship and ongoing rapport. The psychologist needs to clarify their role and reason for the encounter. Maintaining an open and honest dialogue with the individual, along with providing additional education to dispel myths and stigma around mental health, is crucial. How a psychologist may go about engaging the patient may be <span id="ITerm37">informed </span>by the chart review and collateral interview process. For example, humor can be used to engage an individual whose interpersonal interactions with staff tend to be relaxed and humorous, or the referring healthcare professional or trusted healthcare team member can introduce the psychologist.</p><div class="Para" id="Par17">Following the introduction, the psychologist can clarify the individual’s understanding of the referral or the context of the symptoms conveyed by the referral source. This step may involve open-ended questions, structured interviews, and standardized assessment tools. At this time, the psychologist may utilize their judgment to proceed with questioning. Having conducted a chart review may decrease the time spent on collecting a psychosocial history, so the psychologist may focus on clarifying information, identifying potential contributing factors such as a history of violence or trauma, and structuring the interview to target the presenting difficulties. The psychologist can <span id="ITerm38">explore </span>the symptoms’ nature, severity, and duration and how they impact various areas of their life and daily functioning. The psychologist gathers important information the individual reports while noting behavioral observations, including cognitive status, energy level, and affective expression during the interaction. If applicable, the psychologist will also conduct a risk and safety assessment. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">20.3</a></span> highlights the pathways used to collect information. Throughout the clinical interview process, the psychologist strives to create a safe and supportive environment for the individual to explore their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, aiming to promote <span id="ITerm39">psychological</span> well-being and facilitate positive change.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig3"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO3"><img alt="" src="../images/106097_6_En_20_Chapter/106097_6_En_20_Fig3_HTML.png" style="width:33.75em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 20.3</span><p class="SimplePara">Pathways to information <span id="ITerm40">gathering</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading">Recommendations for Formal Assessment</h2><p class="Para" id="Par18">In a clinic or <span id="ITerm41">setting</span> in which holistic care is the primary approach, a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">holistic clinical interview</em> aims to understand the individual as a whole, considering comprehensively in depth their psychological symptoms, physical health, social environment, cultural background, and spiritual beliefs. Holistic approaches utilize the biopsychosocial model of care and an intersectional lens more heavily than a functional interview, which will be discussed below. For example, if an older adult, first-generation immigrant female patient arrives at the clinic with sleep concerns, the clinician will assess in great length their behaviors, lifestyle, identity, trauma, immigration journey, and medical and mental health history, in conjunction with assessment of their sleep concerns and habits. Treatment goals are eventually established, with all relevant history and information gathered in mind.</p><div class="Para" id="Par19">Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">20.1</a></span> illustrates <span id="ITerm42">an </span>example of information collected in a holistic interview.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustrations</h2><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar8"><div class="Heading">Case #1: Primary Care Outpatient Mental Health Referral and Warm Hand-Off to Home Base Care Psychologist</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par22">Ana is a 92-year-old bi-lingual Spanish and English-speaking Latina cisgender female who uses <span id="ITerm48">she/her/hers</span> pronouns and was referred to psychology for transfer of care from an outpatient primary care setting to a home-based primary care setting. She was engaged in outpatient psychotherapy for 1 year, addressing increased anxiety and coinciding decline in overall health. About 6 months before engaging with home-based primary care, she was experiencing difficulty attending medical appointments with an increase in fear of leaving her apartment. The outpatient psychologist transitioned care via telehealth to accommodate Ana’s fear of leaving her apartment. Treatment was at a standstill, with Ana’s symptoms appearing to worsen. Ana and the current psychologist agreed that treatment could better suit the Ana’s needs and progress if transitioned to the home-based team psychologist.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Chart Review</strong>. The medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic diarrhea. The psychiatric history is significant for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major <span id="ITerm49">depressive</span> disorder, recurrent, with anxious distress and agoraphobia. Ana’s doctor prescribed several medications treating diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and depression. Her chart noted a recent inconsistency in managing her medications while also reporting an increase in symptoms related to anxiety and agoraphobia. The record review also revealed a history of intimate partner violence (IPV), a 50-year history of cigarette use, a family history of cardiovascular health problems, and colon cancer. A review of recent home-based primary care healthcare professional notes corroborated observations of inconsistent medication management, increased incontinence, accidents, and small lesions and scabs on her arms and legs, which she self-reported as a “nervous habit.” Additionally, Ana was adamant about having female-only healthcare professionals, citing extreme distrust of men.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Warm Hand-Off and Clinical Interview</strong>. A scheduled joint telehealth visit occurred between the outpatient psychologist, Ana, and the home-based psychologist. At this time, the home-based psychologist introduced themselves and reviewed their role in Ana’s home-based primary care team. The outpatient psychologist reviewed the treatment course and allowed time for Ana to share additional thoughts and questions with the new home-based psychologist. The home-based psychologist asked Ana if she preferred to have the session conducted in Spanish or English, to which she <span id="ITerm50">responded</span>, “I sometimes go back and forth, so if you can keep up, we should be fine!”. The home-based psychologist scheduled a two-week in-person follow-up and confirmed with Ana. The psychologist explained what she should expect related to reviewing her background and what Ana identifies as the current difficulty or need for psychotherapy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">In preparation for the in-person visit, the home-based psychologist prepared an intake evaluation with information gathered from the chart review and collateral information from the home-based primary care team members to assist in clarification and gathering of additional pertinent information not already specified. The psychologist arrived on time, and Ana was seated in her recliner. Ana had unlocked her apartment door when the psychologist buzzed into the low-income housing complex and arrived at her door. Ana asked for the psychologist to lock the door behind them, indicating that her neighbors and other residents often “yell and slam their doors. They’ve even tried to break in here from this door and my sliding door balcony!” Ana appeared to be winded, and when the psychologist commented on the observation, she acknowledged that transferring from her motorized wheelchair to the recliner was causing her to be out of breath and that, eventually, she would return to baseline. The psychologist also observed Ana rocking back <span id="ITerm51">and</span> forth in her recliner throughout the encounter. Her home appeared organized and clean, and her decorations included family photographs, art pieces, plants, and crafts.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">The psychologist reintroduced themselves and inquired about Ana’s pronouns and how she would like to be addressed. The psychologist proceeded with informed consent, privacy and confidentiality limits, a review of abuse and mandated reporter status, and an overview of the session. The psychologist allowed Ana to ask questions and identify her goals and concerns. The interview began with the psychologist asking about Ana’s past engagement with mental health and psychotherapy and inquiring about her experiences, what went well, what she wished would have been done, or what expectations for therapy were not met/met. Ana indicated she had previously worked on feeling <span id="ITerm52">less</span> depressed by finding ways to engage creatively, which worked the best. Ana also noted she had also seen therapists for trauma work yet could not recall the type of trauma-based work or interventions she had learned, “It was a long time ago, and I find that my memory isn’t as good as it used to be.” She also shared that she attempted group-based therapy in the remote past and found it unhelpful, “I couldn’t relate to what the women were sharing.”</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">Regarding her current concerns and symptoms, Ana reported she began experiencing increased panic when leaving her apartment following a period of distressing exchanges she overheard occurring outside her apartment, “There were three days of shouting from my direct neighbor. Someone was banging on the door, saying something about payment and threats. It was terrifying. I called the police, but nothing came of it. When it happened again the next day, I called the leasing office to tell them, but again, nothing was done.” Ana indicated that she had already had trouble with her <span id="ITerm53">sleep</span> but has experienced more problems with frequent nighttime awakenings and getting back to sleep. She also noted that she has experienced recurrent nightmares and daydreaming about her traumatic experiences, specifically related to IPV. She finds herself feeling startled by any noise she hears coming from the halls outside her apartment, “I don’t feel safe. I need to move, but I don’t know if I can”.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">The psychologist listened attentively and structured the interview in an organic manner, taking cues from what Ana was sharing and corroborating and clarifying information noted in the prepared intake. Inquiry about Ana’s current living environment led to a conversation about her relationship status, history, and family dynamics. Ana’s home-based social worker verified information about her current supports: home health aide twice a week for a total of eight hours through her state Medicare benefits and visits from her daughter, who also lives locally, about once a month. Ana shared mixed feelings about her daughter’s visits, indicating that she looks forward to seeing her, “She works two jobs, and she does what she can for me. I sometimes feel bad when she leaves because she looks so exhausted, and sometimes her children don’t help around their apartment. <span id="ITerm54">Her</span> long-time boyfriend died suddenly; she’s on her own now, but my grandchildren take advantage of her. I don’t know why she can’t tell them to contribute. I would if I could, but I’m just as bad.”</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">The psychologist asked about additional changes Ana has noticed regarding her physical and mental health as she ages. Ana recalled her recent visit from the home-based R.N., “Well, she told me that I actually hadn’t taken any medications correctly. I thought I was, but it turns out I was taking my insulin wrong, and I wasn’t taking my water pills. I don’t know. It’s just been too hard to think. I have my son’s death anniversary coming up, and I’m worried about my granddaughter. She is skipping school, and my sister tells me I’m losing my mind.” At this time, Ana increased the rocking motion in her chair. The psychologist checked in with Ana and asked how she was feeling emotionally. The psychologist initiated a grounding exercise, and the back-and-forth rocking decreased. The psychologist reflected on her observation and the distress and impact of what Ana shared. <span id="ITerm55">Ana</span> acknowledged feeling overwhelmed with her medical and physical problems and wondered, “Why would God keep me here. I wonder what it would be like to not wake up.” The psychologist followed up with a suicide and homicide risk assessment. The psychologist determined that the current ideation did not require further assessment and queried Ana’s values and meaning around end-of-life care. Ana discussed her history with religion and indicated she still finds she is spiritual and will engage in prayer and meditation. She shared a childhood memory of the death of her younger brother and the comfort she received from her father. Ana reflected on receiving comfort through prayer during the time of her son’s unexpected death. She became tearful. The psychologist provided silence and space for Ana to express her emotions. The psychologist thanked Ana for sharing this story and for the profound impact of prayer on her pain.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">In the last 10 min of the encounter, the psychologist asked Ana about her strengths and what mattered most regarding her overall self. Ana responded, “I love my family. I would say that I would do everything and do anything for them. I want to be able to go out again; I want to visit my sister, my children, and my grandchildren. I don’t go out.” The psychologist summarized the encounter and Ana’s current concerns, areas of difficulty, and overall goals. The psychologist proposed a trauma-informed treatment plan that included targeting pronounced symptoms of fear, <span id="ITerm56">avoidance</span>, hypervigilance, and worry. The psychologist proposed a Stop-Worry protocol validated for older adults with a discussion of incorporating Ana’s values and previously learned tools to increase motivation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">Concerning Ana’s memory, the psychologist offered to administer a brief cognitive screener at the following or future session to help better understand her cognitive strengths and areas of weakness. The psychologist also indicated that she would be working closely with Ana’s home-based team to help support her medical concerns. The psychologist reminded Ana about the trial of a medication planner system to aid in medication adherence. The psychologist asked for feedback regarding today’s encounter, including Ana’s expectations of how she thought the session would go and comments on how it went. Ana indicated she felt comfortable with the psychologist and asked if the psychologist would “leave after a year. That’s been my experience, and I feel tired of having to explain myself again and again.” The psychologist validated Ana’s feelings and indicated that their time together would end at some point, depending on many factors, including treatment effectiveness, outcomes, or health changes. At this time, Ana agreed to continue working with <span id="ITerm57">the</span> psychologist and scheduled a follow-up visit.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar9"><div class="Heading">Case #2: The Primary Care Patient</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par32">Mrs. Phyllis June is an 82-year-old, black, married, heterosexual, cisgender woman of Buddhist spirituality who uses she/her/hers pronouns. She received Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) services and was referred to the team psychologist by the R.N. after reporting increased difficulties with chronic pain. The R.N. stated that the patient agreed to meet with the team psychologist after learning that there were options for chronic pain treatment that did not involve medication, as she was interested in other forms of pain management.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Chart Review</strong>. Per Phyllis’ electronic health record, she has had a history of chronic pain for the last 20 years. Records <span id="ITerm58">indicate</span> she has been compliant with attending medical appointments and medication management. She has no history of smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Functional Clinical Interview</strong>. Phyllis’ functional clinical interview was conducted at her assisted living facility (ALF), in her kitchen, with her husband nearby in the living room, with her consent. The home appeared to be free of clutter, spacious, with plenty of light. No signs of neglect or other concerns were evident. The home-based primary care psychologist reviewed the limits of confidentiality and her role in Phyllis’ care. The psychologist also outlined the expected procedures for the clinical interview and assessments.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Phyllis reported herself to be an 82-year-old, non-disabled, Buddhist, Black, heterosexual, middle class, American, and female. Phyllis reported obtaining her associate’s degree and working in <span id="ITerm59">education</span> for her career. She is married to her husband of 54 years, and they recently moved into an assisted living facility about 45 minutes from the community where they had lived for much of their life. Phyllis expressed gratitude that her three children and five grandchildren are supportive and active in their lives, though they have not been able to visit as much due to the distance between their new ALF.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Phyllis reported her chief complaint to be chronic pain. She stated that she has had chronic pain for the last 20 years and found it manageable until her recent move. Phyllis identified her current pain level to be an eight, whereas typically, it is a four or a five. She stated she uses ibuprofen, heating, and ice to manage it. Phyllis shared that walking was a great form of exercise that she could do even when her pain was problematic.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">She reported no new medications; however, she reported slight dietary changes due to now eating the assisted-living food. She shared that she usually gets adequate sleep and typically feels rested. Phyllis stated she occasionally feels it would be easier if she could just “not wake up” in the morning but denied <span id="ITerm60">any </span>active suicidal ideation, plan, or intent. She cited her protective factors as her family and religion.</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">She denied any past psychiatric history other than feeling very depressed after a miscarriage in her early 30s. Phyllis also denied any recent cognitive changes, history of TBI, or head traumas. She reported no difficulties walking, and the psychologist also observed an independent and steady gait—no clutter in the home or medications that could contribute to fall risks.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Phyllis discussed how she used to be much more active around the home and in her community until her recent move. She stated that she and her husband attended many social events at the senior center, played cards, and enjoyed connection with their religious community. She stated that she and her husband have maintained their intimacy satisfactorily. Phyllis denied any financial or legal concerns. Phyllis denied any identity stressors. However, upon asking the “miracle question” - if you could engage in therapy and have things be exactly how you want them to be, what would your life look like? She stated that she would have her ALF be in her long-time community or bring <span id="ITerm61">her </span>community to the ALF.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Upon asking more open-ended questions, such as how her community contributed to her pain levels, Phyllis stated that she was more active and comfortable with them because they shared the same racial identity as her and that at the ALF she and her husband are relatively the only black individuals at the facility. Phyllis shared that she feels out of place and that she does not attend the social events or exercise classes held at the facility because of her minority status, which she knows would help her pain levels. She identified this as a barrier to change and stated she is open to discussing more in therapy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">After the interview, the writer reflected appreciation for Phyllis’ disclosures. Though typically, a protocol of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) would be recommended, it became evident <span id="ITerm62">that</span> Phyllis is aware of how her behavioral activation contributes to her chronic pain and that her most significant source of stress and barrier is her experience of isolation as an individual with a minority identity in her new ALF. Consequently, the writer suggested that the next session focus on building rapport, continuing to discuss Phyllis’ experience, and developing a gradual exposure hierarchy. As with functional care settings, the psychologist assigned a small task: for Phyllis to spend time between sessions identifying activities around the ALF that she may enjoy, even if she does not <span id="ITerm63">wish </span>to do them just yet.</p></div></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Sex/Gender, Culture, Race, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par42">Psychologists must tune into aspects of diversity during the assessment process and throughout therapy. Identity factors are often social determinants of health, and according to the American Psychological Association (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>), best practices in evidence-based assessment and therapy should incorporate identity. Addressing diversity factors is a critical element in the biopsychosocial approach. Additionally, psychologists must demonstrate cultural humility and competency throughout the patient-therapist relationship. Psychologists follow ethical <span id="ITerm64">principles</span> and a code of conduct (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Specifically, the principles of justice and respect for people’s rights and dignity encompass our duty to address how our clients’ identities, lived experiences, and overall health factor into the care we provide and how we deliver our care. Exploring diversity factors contributes to obtaining the most comprehensive assessment and optimizes rapport, which we know is the number one predictor of a successful therapeutic outcome (Norcross &amp; Lambert, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Using the case examples from above and <span id="ITerm65">integration </span>of Hays’ (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR01" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) ADDRESSING framework, we reflect on ways attention to identity and related intersecting factors can assist in the way psychologists establish rapport and relationships, formulate impressions, recommend treatments, and influence outcomes. We also specifically address these factors per the above case vignettes.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Age/Generation</h3><p class="Para" id="Par43">The importance of assessing <span id="ITerm66">age/generation</span> is underscored when we consider generational influences and how those may impact the patient’s self and worldview. What did they live through politically? Socioeconomically? Scientifically? Social justice movements? Do they hold internalized ageist attitudes?</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June’s, age and generational influences may inform the case given that she is a black woman who lived through the desegregation of schools, which means she likely experienced educational racism, in addition to systemic and overall overt institutional racism. Further, she was also alive during the Tuskegee Syphilis studies from 1932 to 1972, whereby many black individuals’ mistrust of the healthcare system developed and was reinforced. Furthermore, it may have been beneficial to assess for any ageist views that she holds of herself, internalized ageism, such as, “Well, I am getting older and just moved into the old folks’ home, so it may be a lost cause anyways.”</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Ana, from case example one, is 92 years old. As the daughter of immigrants, she was born during the <span id="ITerm67">Great Depression</span>, a time of significant economic hardship. At this time, limited access to essential resources such <span id="ITerm68">as</span> housing, healthcare, and nutrition severely impacted Latinx families, who also faced racism and discrimination. Often, families relied on community support, if available, or were faced to make ends meet. As an infant, Ana’s mortality was in peril due to limitations on nutrition for infants at this time; however, she survived. Considering her development in adolescence and young adulthood, Ana may also have been subject to abandoning her education to find work and financially help the family. Individuals and families faced considerable financial hardships at this time, considering the influence of Ana’s upbringing and her comments regarding frustration in seeing her daughter’s <span id="ITerm69">financial</span> struggles.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec10"><h3 class="Heading">Disability Status (Developmental and Acquired)</h3><p class="Para" id="Par46"><span id="ITerm70">Psychologists </span>must assess for developmental (e.g., intellectual, autism, cerebral palsy, etc.) and acquired disability (e.g., TBI, amputation, etc.). In the case of Phyllis, she did not have any developmental or acquired disabilities. If she were to have had something, say she utilized a cane to assist in mobility due to her chronic pain, how would this influence her self-esteem and sense of self in general? Would this influence her willingness to go into public, given that this could be considered an overtly obvious disability?</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">The psychologist working with Ana observed her reliance on a mobility assistive device. She used a motorized wheelchair and experienced difficulty transferring. This difficulty with transfer affected her physical comfort and her mental health. Further exploration of comorbid incontinence issues and COPD may also garner insight <span id="ITerm71">into </span>how these issues may be contributing to symptoms of agoraphobia, excoriation, and anxiety. Additionally, Ana reported challenges with medication management, and it is an additional indicated need for support and monitoring. Assessing for potential cognitive decline with a cognitive screener can help tailor interventions to her cognitive strengths and weaknesses. A brief cognitive assessment may also provide insight for the psychologist to consider a referral for comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation if Ana’s symptoms worsen over time. Ana also noted fears about her neighbors and the safety of her apartment. These are significant stressors that exacerbate her mental health symptoms. Limited mobility and fear of leaving her apartment contribute to social isolation, impacting her mental health and overall quality of life. Consulting with social workers may <span id="ITerm72">help </span>provide additional resources on alternate housing, possible collaboration with the housing office, or other available safety precautions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">Partnering with additional specialty professions such as occupational and physical therapy, social work, speech, and audiology, to name a few, is best practice to help bridge the gap between the individual and their ability to continue navigating the world meaningfully. Further work with individuals with developmental and acquired disabilities may also ask us to consider modifying the materials we present to them, such as audio <span id="ITerm73">format</span>, large print, braille, lighting, and pocket-talkers.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec11"><h3 class="Heading">Religion and Spiritual Orientation</h3><p class="Para" id="Par49">Religious and spiritual <span id="ITerm74">orientation</span> is a protective factor for patients and a source of strength and resilience to capitalize upon in therapy. Religious and spiritual commitment can vary. Furthermore, some religions may not be open to practicing some third-wave therapeutic strategies, such as mindfulness and meditation. In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June, her Buddhist spirituality may help guide the behaviors she chooses to engage in during treatment. She may also wish to engage in more meditation or mindfulness to facilitate her behavioral activation. Moreover, it is also possible that Phyllis has noticed herself engaging in less spiritual practices; as we <span id="ITerm75">know</span>, at times, patients can withdraw from valued activities when feeling down, which may be an area to target.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">Ana finds comfort in prayer and meditation, which are integral to her coping strategies and overall well-being. Understanding her spiritual background can help integrate culturally relevant practices into her treatment plan. We could consider the individual’s community involvement and review her participation in spiritual practices within this setting. Alternatively, if the healthcare system offers <span id="ITerm76">chaplain</span> services, requesting a referral may be another option to explore and help individuals get connected.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec12"><h3 class="Heading">Ethnicity</h3><p class="Para" id="Par51"><span id="ITerm77">Ethnicity</span> may be an overt, observable difference between the individual and the clinician. Exploring ethnic identity could impact trust, rapport, and willingness to open up in the therapeutic context. In the case of Phyllis, if the clinician were of a different ethnicity than her, it would be valuable to acknowledge this openly. For example, stating, “I am not going to pretend I know what it is like to be a black woman living in America. I may bring to our relationship new tools for you to navigate your chronic pain, and you come with your lived experiences, and together, we can co-construct the space between us to facilitate a more meaningful life for you.”</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">In case example one, the psychologist’s chart review revealed Ana’s bilingual background, prompting the language preference inquiry. She preferred to alternate between Spanish and English during sessions, highlighting the importance of cultural sensitivity and linguistic flexibility. In <span id="ITerm78">this </span>case, the psychologist was also bilingual and could continue engaging Ana and establishing treatment. Had the psychologist and Ana been unable to communicate, the psychologist would identify potential referrals that would accommodate Ana’s language abilities by seeking additional community or hospital referrals, utilizing an interpreter service, and consulting with additional professionals to assist in connecting Ana appropriately.</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">The psychologist was partially attuned to understanding Ana’s ethnic background. The psychologist would <span id="ITerm79">need</span> to follow up and ask how Ana identifies ethnically and how this identity may impact her current state. Further exploration ensures our evaluations and treatments’ accuracy, relevance, and fairness. We can see how ethnicity influences the presentation of Ana’s symptoms. For example, considering Ana’s reporting of her relationship with her daughter and her values related to family, we can consider that her expression is culturally rooted rather than pathological. Exploring ethnicity helps avoid misdiagnosis and ensures the psychologist considers cultural variations in the <span id="ITerm80">assessment</span> formulation process.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading">Socioeconomic Status</h3><p class="Para" id="Par54"><span id="ITerm81">Socioeconomic status</span><span id="ITerm82"/> is multifaceted. On one hand, education and income fall under an individual’s objective socioeconomic status. There is also a person’s subjective or perceived socioeconomic status, which research is finding also plays a significant role in overall well-being (Navarro-Carrillo et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Furthermore, clinicians must also be mindful of an intersectional perspective, as socioeconomic status and resources can also be influenced by ageism, racism, gender stereotypes, disability, and more. The role of socioeconomic status in resource availability and access to basic needs can impact a patient’s health and priorities in the therapeutic context.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">In the case of Mrs. Phyllis June, she did not describe financial difficulties during the intake appointment. However, upon further conversation, it became apparent that the assisted living facility is 45 minutes <span id="ITerm83">away</span><span id="ITerm84"/> from her family, who no longer can visit her as much because the nearby facility was too expensive and did not accept the couple’s long-term care planning health insurance, for which they had spent their adulthood contributing. Consequently, though they had worked hard to plan for these circumstances, not being near her community and family is a significant stressor for her. She had also wished to leave her children more money upon her death. However, the cost of living in the ALF is starting to exhaust some of those funds. Phyllis verbalized resentment about this situation, which decreased her interest in attending ALF events.</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">In case example one, the psychologist gathered chart review data and later observational data regarding Ana’s socioeconomic status. <span id="ITerm85">She</span><span id="ITerm86"/> lives in a low-income housing complex, which may impact her sense of safety and contribute to stress and anxiety. Additional information gathered from additional home-based team member visits noted limited income and financial support primarily from state-funded resources. This information is vital to understanding how her access to care and financial constraints likely influenced her access to healthcare and support services. Continued coordination with home-based primary care services is essential to effectively manage her medical <span id="ITerm87">and</span><span id="ITerm88"/> psychological needs.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec14"><h3 class="Heading">Sexual Orientation</h3><p class="Para" id="Par57">The health field <span id="ITerm89">recognizes</span><span id="ITerm90"/> sexual orientation as a social determinant of health (Andrinopoulos &amp; Hembling, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). Many organizations, such as some Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, have begun to ask this question bi-yearly. Psychologists should not assume that something has not changed because the patient has been asked about it previously, or the willingness to disclose has become more open with time. Again, we can underscore the intersectional nature of sexual orientation as it also pertains to age/cohort differences and religion—did the patient live through the HIV crisis? Did they grow up under strict religious pretenses that condemned the LGBTQ community? Were they in the military when individuals were punished for same-sex sexual acts?</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">Clinicians should approach the topic of relationships and sexual orientation with intentional neutrality. For <span id="ITerm91">example</span><span id="ITerm92"/>, when asking a patient about their relationship status, regardless of gender expression/sex, the clinician can say, “Are you partnered? Do you have more than one partner?” Asking in this manner creates an open and safe dialogue without assumptions regarding the person’s sexuality. You may have had the experience of being at a medical appointment and being asked, if your gender expression is assumed feminine, “Do you have a boyfriend?” or if your gender expression is assumed masculine, “Do you have a wife?” These questions automatically apply assumption and, for some with a marginalized identity, may create discomfort in sharing the identity of their partner(s), and/or mistrust that if they were to share, they may receive less adequate or biased care. Furthermore, a person’s relationship status/partner’s gender does not indicate their sexual orientation. Thus, asking “What is your sexual orientation?” or “How would you describe your sexual orientation?” is essential.</p><p class="Para" id="Par59">In the case of Phyllis, though she is married to a man, it is still important to ask about her sexual orientation. It can <span id="ITerm93">be</span><span id="ITerm94"/> easy to assume, given her long-time marriage. However, this can also be an avenue for building more rapport, particularly if she does hold a diverse sexual identity, and has been hiding it for most of her life due to stigma growing up in her generation, living through events such as the Stonewall Riots, or Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell—even though they may not have applied to her directly, she was exposed to these movements which may have influenced her willingness to disclose her own identity as a queer black woman.</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">Chart review of case example one noted Ana’s reporting a life-long heterosexual sexual orientation and cisgender female identity. The psychologist introduced themselves and pronouns and offered for Ana to share in return. Sexual orientation was verified and confirmed with Ana. Ana did not elaborate on her past and current romantic relationships but confirmed a traumatic history with male partners. Ana’s confirmation of her trauma history, in part, was a reason for her continued request for a female-only healthcare team. Asking about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) reduces healthcare disparities <span id="ITerm95">and</span><span id="ITerm96"/> risks and highlights potential needs that may otherwise be overlooked.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec15"><h3 class="Heading">Indigenous Cultural Heritage</h3><p class="Para" id="Par61">Indigenous <span id="ITerm97">heritage</span><span id="ITerm98"/> includes a patient’s tangible (e.g., clothing, carvings, art, medicine) and non-tangible (e.g., language, dance, music, stories, rules/laws) elements. Ask a patient, “Are there elements of your culture and heritage that are important to you?” “How does your culture and heritage impact you daily and globally?”</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">As described, Phyllis is currently in an ALF. Though she appreciates the opportunity for her new residence, her resentment, as described in the socioeconomic status section, in conjunction with the lack of community, has decreased behavioral activation. Discussing her Indigenous heritage can help identify non-tangible and tangible elements of her culture. The psychologist can use motivational interviewing through a culturally aware lens to facilitate exploring additional activities and incorporate more movement and engagement in Phyllis’ routine.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">The psychologist working with Ana is attuned to exploring her cultural background. The psychologist asked Ana about her experiences, values, family dynamics, and spirituality. Although these aspects may not always align with an individual’s cultural identity, the psychologist can promote further insight into her values, experiences, and potential barriers to treatment with further <span id="ITerm99">exploration</span><span id="ITerm100"/> of the individual’s cultural heritage and background. Understanding an individual’s cultural background can inform more personalized and effective treatment plans. For example, considering Ana’s relationship with her daughter, we may ask if she would like to involve her daughter in therapy and treatment planning with her medical team. This option may be an effective intervention for individuals from collectivistic cultures such as <span id="ITerm101">Latinx </span><span id="ITerm102"/>communities.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec16"><h3 class="Heading">National Origin</h3><p class="Para" id="Par64"><span id="ITerm103">National origin</span> addresses the influence of a patient’s immigration status, refugee status, and those who may be international students (Hays, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>, p. 335). Mrs. Phyllis June did not report any national origin other than the United States. The psychologist could capitalize on Phyllis’ national identity by noting her resilience in navigating new situations, which could be drawn upon during therapy to facilitate her willingness to engage in more ALF activities.</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">Similarly, Ana was also born in the United States; however, her parents were immigrants to the United States. Consider how a younger Ana may have navigated a bicultural experience, balancing the expectations of her cultural heritage with the pressures of assimilating into mainstream society. Exploring Ana’s connectedness or disconnectedness to her cultural heritage and American society may reveal additional helpful <span id="ITerm104">information</span> aiding treatment planning.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec17"><h3 class="Heading">Gender</h3><p class="Para" id="Par66">A person’s self-identified <span id="ITerm105">gender</span> expression can largely contribute to their lived experiences of facing stigma and sexism. Within an intersectional lens, age, race, and religion are compounded by oppressed and marginalized identities and other psychosocial variables. During assessment, a psychologist may ask the patient “How would you describe your gender identity?” In the case of Phyllis, she identifies as a female, and the intersection of this with her identity as a black, older adult woman has likely contributed to the gendered racism and ageism she has felt throughout her life.</p><p class="Para" id="Par67">Ana identified as a cisgender female. Exploring how gender may influence the presentation of symptoms reported for long-standing PTSD and recent symptoms of agoraphobia coupled with medical comorbidities can help <span id="ITerm106">inform </span>treatment planning. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) has a breakdown of gender considerations following the criteria guidelines for each disorder. This manual is a helpful source for formulating diagnoses and treatment planning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par68">Trans, nonbinary, and two-spirit individuals face unique stressors and societal pressures. As stated in the <span id="ITerm107">Sexual </span>Orientation section, gender identity is also a social determinant of health. For transgender, non-binary, and two-spirited individuals, gender identity and expression are central to their self-concept and well-being. Assessing and affirming their gender identity is crucial for their mental health. Ignoring this can lead to further distress and harm and exacerbate mental health issues.</p><p class="Para" id="Par69">Substantial literature has demonstrated that transgender and gender-diverse youth and adolescents face significant health disparities due to bullying, emotional distress, and substance use (Eisenberg et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Furthermore, researchers found that these factors contribute to a heightened risk of chronic diseases and educational/financial disparities in adulthood as a result of untreated injury and illness-related concerns or behaviors (Eisenberg et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par70">Recognizing how these diverse and intersecting identity factors influence patients’ experiences and treatment needs is crucial for providing holistic and culturally competent care. The psychologist’s sensitivity <span id="ITerm108">to</span> these factors through language accommodations, understanding of the patient’s cultural context, SOGI, and addressing socioeconomic and environmental stressors contributes to a respected and safe environment and strong therapeutic foundation for continued engagement. This comprehensive approach supports the development of an effective, personalized treatment plan that addresses the multifaceted <span id="ITerm109">nature</span> of the patient’s identity and experiences.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec18"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par71">A diagnostic <span id="ITerm110">interview</span> that produces an accurate diagnosis is valuable for various reasons. It informs treatment planning, informs team members in both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary settings about the patient and what may benefit their care (e.g., trauma-informed approach to physical exams, psychiatry medication management, cognition’s impact on retention of information, etc.), and of course, within the medical model, produces a billing code for insurance companies. The medical model has shifted the field of psychology considerably in that it relies on categorical labels to describe the patient experience. Medical providers and clinicians use <span id="ITerm111">Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes</span> to report services and determine reimbursement rates. According to American Psychological Association (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>), the three most common codes used by psychologists are Health and Behavior Assessment and Intervention (96156–96171), Psychotherapy Codes (CPT codes 90832–90863), and Psychological and Neuropsychological Testing Codes (CPT codes 96105–96146). There are <span id="ITerm112">also </span>Caregiver Behavior Management Training Codes, Consultation Codes, and more. Commonly within the healthcare setting, mental health codes are secondary to the medical diagnosis, which results in using Health and Behavior Assessment CPT codes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par72">However, as we know from being human, every person is nuanced and unique, hence the value of the biopsychosocial model and flexibility within treatment settings despite the diagnoses. According to the American Psychological Association (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>), the APA Council of Representatives released a statement in 2005 underscoring the importance of utilizing evidence-based practice in the treatment of disorders, which encompasses research evidence with patient values, strengths, personality, and sociocultural context.</p><p class="Para" id="Par73">Additionally, a psychologist should consider an individual’s past psychiatric diagnosis (diagnosis by history), rule-outs and differentials, and provisional and Z-code diagnosis when formulating a diagnostic impression. As previously stated, completing a chart review, obtaining collateral information, initiating an interview with the individual, noting observations, and conducting brief mood and cognitive screeners provide a psychologist with the necessary information to form a comprehensive diagnosis and treatment planning.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec19"><h3 class="Heading">Diagnosis by History</h3><p class="Para" id="Par74">Diagnosing mental <span id="ITerm113">health </span>conditions by history involves the individual’s past and present experiences, behaviors, and symptoms. Reviewing past interviews with the individual and identifying their subjective experiences, including mood, thought patterns, behavior changes, and functional impairments, can give the psychologist a starting point of what symptomology may resurface or progress and help distinguish between acute, episodic, and chronic conditions. Additionally, identifying <span id="ITerm114">past</span> family medical and psychiatric history and the individual’s social and developmental history may help identify potential genetic and environmental influences. The benefits of accessing this information include helping the psychologist and healthcare team identify factors contributing to or exacerbating the individual’s mental and physical health. Identifying past mental health and comorbid diagnoses also facilitates the development of a treatment plan that addresses <span id="ITerm115">the</span> unique needs of the individual.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec20"><h3 class="Heading">Differentials and Rule-Outs</h3><p class="Para" id="Par75"><span id="ITerm116">Differential and rule-out</span> diagnoses involve distinguishing between two or more conditions that share similar symptoms to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis. This process requires a systematic approach with careful consideration of all possible diagnoses. The key steps involved include reviewing the individual’s symptoms: duration, severity, nature, and impact on daily life. Next, identify possible physical health conditions that could mimic psychiatric symptoms (e.g., neurological conditions and thyroid disorders), which a medical health professional can further <span id="ITerm117">examine</span> for appropriate evaluation. In addition to ruling out, a psychologist would also examine comorbidities. Identifying and evaluating co-occurring conditions may aid or complicate the proposed treatment planning and diagnosis. For example, the patient in case example one had a medical condition of <span id="ITerm118">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</span>. Most often, a diagnosis of COPD is comorbid with an anxiety-related mental health diagnosis. Additionally, there is a bi-directional relationship where the symptoms of anxiety may exacerbate the symptoms of COPD and vice-versa. Accurately diagnosing and treating the primary condition and comorbidities <span id="ITerm119">improves</span> the prognosis and overall quality of life for the individual.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec21"><h3 class="Heading">Provisional Diagnosis</h3><p class="Para" id="Par76">Provisional <span id="ITerm120">diagnoses</span> are temporary when sufficient evidence suggests a particular disorder, but confirmatory data is pending (e.g., medical or specialized psychiatric/neuropsychological examinations). Provisional diagnoses allow the psychologist to begin treatment with the best data and information available. Early treatment and intervention can significantly impact prognosis. As treatment takes effect, the diagnostic picture may become more apparent, allowing the psychologist to make further adjustments to the diagnosis. Reviewing the treatment effects and outcomes ensures that the individual’s medical records accurately reflect their current medical status.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec22"><h3 class="Heading">Z-Codes</h3><p class="Para" id="Par77"><span id="ITerm121">Z-codes</span><span id="ITerm122"/> are part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and describe factors influencing the individual’s health status and contact with health services. Z-codes are important in the health care setting as they highlight psychosocial and medical issues, which can lead to better treatment outcomes. Using case example one, collaboration with the individual’s social work professional to address the distress caused by housing, Inadequate Housing (Z59.1) can help facilitate connecting the individual with community-based, <span id="ITerm123">older-adult</span><span id="ITerm124"/> housing options that also factor in her low socioeconomic status, Low Income (Z59.6) which may facilitate connection to additional resources the individual may or may not be aware of applying.</p><p class="Para" id="Par78">Using historical, differentials, rule-outs, provisional, and Z-code diagnoses is integral to a nuanced and dynamic approach to diagnosis. Psychologists in healthcare settings can provide personalized care that addresses several factors affecting an individual’s mental health. By leveraging these diagnostic elements, psychologists can ensure more comprehensive formulations that lead to more accurate diagnoses, <span id="ITerm125">tailored</span><span id="ITerm126"/> treatment plans, and improved outcomes.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec24"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par80">In summary, psychologists play pivotal roles within the healthcare system not just by providing care to individuals and their families and consulting, but also via the opportunity to be someone’s first experience with a mental health clinician. These interactions can open doors and reduce stigmas for the individual and other disciplines through interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaboration. Though being a psychologist within a setting that once viewed the mind and body as separate can be a challenge with various unique complexities, it is also an opportunity to facilitate holistic, equitable, and culturally responsive care through a biopsychosocial lens. It is also an opportunity to learn a breadth of medical knowledge and develop impactful relationships while navigating a fast-paced environment with a myriad of presentations.</p></section>
