At the individual level, depressive disorders are a source of emotional distress and represent the leading cause of disability by accounting for 6.2% of all years lived with a disability (WHO, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR65" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Depressive disorders are also associated with higher suicide risk (Chesney et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>) and lower quality of life (Rapaport et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR50" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). In the broader context, depressive disorders create significant emotional distress and economic burden for families, interpersonal relationships, and society at large. This impact spans across all ages, geographical, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and alarmingly, the lifetime and current rate of depressive disorders has increased over the past several years (Santomauro et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR54" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Given the costs and risks associated with depressive disorders, it is crucial that mental health providers have a comprehensive understanding of diagnostic criteria, evidence-based assessment methods, and cultural considerations for managing depressive disorders.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading">Description of the Disorders</h2><p class="Para" id="Par3"><span id="ITerm2">Depressive disorders</span>, as described by the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em>; American Psychiatric Association (APA), <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>), share symptoms that negatively impact mood (e.g., feelings of sadness), cognition (e.g., difficulty concentrating), and physical being (e.g., psychomotor agitation) and that are severe enough to cause distress or disrupt daily functioning. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> categorizes depressive disorders into eight specific disorders: disruptive mood <span id="ITerm3">dysregulation</span> disorder, major depressive disorder (including major depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Each is discussed next.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par4"><span id="ITerm4">Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)</span> was developed for and included in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em> (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR74" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>) as a means of improving differential diagnosis in children, as rates of misdiagnosis were high (Chilakamarri et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>) and led to concerns about inappropriate or delayed access to appropriate treatment. DMDD is marked by chronic and severe irritability as evidenced by persistent anger and irritable mood interspersed with frequent behavioral outbursts. Behavioral symptoms include repeated verbal or physical outbursts, occurring approximately three times per week, which represent behaviors above and beyond what is merited by a given situation. Further, the outbursts must occur outside of typical levels of development. Associated moods are otherwise consistently irritable day-to-day and readily evident to others (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">Symptoms must occur for at least 12 months without gaps larger than 3 months in symptom presence (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Moreover, the symptoms must occur in multiple (a minimum of two) settings with at least one setting in which symptoms are severe. The onset of symptoms typically occurs before age 10, and initial diagnosis must occur between the ages of 6–18 years. Importantly, there must be no evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes, which is used to differentiate symptoms of <span id="ITerm5">DMDD</span> from symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder. As with other <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em> disorders, other diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder must not better account for the outbursts and irritable mood, and neither substance use nor physical conditions may be responsible for the behaviors associated with DMDD. Studies have reported a high comorbidity of DMDD with other behavioral disorders, including Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Axelson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">Upwards of 5% of children from clinical samples display the primary DMDD feature of persistent irritability, and the estimated three-month prevalence rate of DMDD in a community sample ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%, with 1% meeting full criteria (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>; Copeland et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). <span id="ITerm6">DMDD</span> is most frequently diagnosed in early childhood and affects preschoolers the most (Copeland et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>). Greater rates of DMDD are predicted in boys (vs. girls) and younger children (vs. adolescents) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Notably, sociocultural factors may affect the presentation of core symptoms of DMDD (e.g., impulsivity, emotion, behavior regulation), especially in contexts impacted by severe social disruption (e.g., post-conflict zones or communities affected by systemic racism and discrimination) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Major Depressive Disorder</h3><div class="Para" id="Par7">Given its wide prevalence and clinical severity, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the prototype of depressive disorders and is marked by a Major Depressive Episode (MDE), which is a distinct period of change in emotional and/or physical functioning lasting a minimum of 2 weeks (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In addition to low mood (sadness) or decreased pleasure or interest in usual activities (anhedonia), at least four other symptoms related to changes in weight, sleep, physical movement, energy level, <span id="ITerm7">feelings</span> of worthlessness or guilt, ability to concentrate, and/or thoughts about death or suicide (either thoughts or attempts) must be present to fulfill criteria for an MDE (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">6.1</a></span>). These symptoms must result in personal distress or otherwise substantially affect one’s ability to perform important activities (e.g., work or social activities). Lastly, the symptoms may not be caused by a substance or physical/medical problem. Additional criteria for MDD include that the disorder cannot be better accounted for by other disorders (e.g., schizophrenia or psychotic disorders) or there must not be evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes (which are more characteristic of a bipolar disorder) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 6.1</span><p class="SimplePara">DSM-5-TR symptoms of depressive disorders for differential <span id="ITerm8">diagnosis</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Major depressive disorder</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">At least five symptoms must be present and last the majority of the day for most days for at least 2 weeks:</p><p class="SimplePara"> 1. Depressed mood</p><p class="SimplePara"> 2. Anhedonia</p><p class="SimplePara"> 3. Substantial weight or appetite change</p><p class="SimplePara"> 4. Changes in sleep (e.g., insomnia or hypersomnia)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 5. Observable agitation or retardation of motor movements</p><p class="SimplePara"> 6. Changes in energy level (e.g., fatigue)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 7. Experience of worthlessness or feelings of guilt</p><p class="SimplePara"> 8. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</p><p class="SimplePara"> 9. Thoughts of death or suicide (ideation or attempt)</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Depressed mood must be present and last a majority of the day for most days for at least 2 years, AND at least two symptoms must be present:</p><p class="SimplePara"> 1. Appetite change (overeating or reduced appetite)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 2. Changes in sleep (e.g., insomnia or hypersomnia)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 3. Changes in energy level (e.g., fatigue)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 4. Lowered self-esteem</p><p class="SimplePara"> 5. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</p><p class="SimplePara"> 6. Experience of hopelessness</p><p class="SimplePara">Major depressive disorder criteria may also be met throughout the course of PDD</p></td><td style="text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Mood changes must begin 1 week pre-menses and improve by one-week post-menses and be present for most menstrual cycles within the past year.

Symptoms associated with MDD may certainly overlap with those of grief and bereavement (e.g., changes in appetite or weight), yet MDD can only be diagnosed if an MDE is established. Given the prevalence of bereavement in late life, clinicians and researchers should take care not to misdiagnose intense grief reactions as <span id="ITerm9">MDD</span> in older adults (Wakefield &amp; First, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>). Thus, it is essential to approach diagnosis holistically and in consideration of personal history and relevant cultural factors (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">MDD can be classified based on severity, recurrence, presence of psychosis, and level of remission (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Mild</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">moderate</em>, or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">severe</em> specifiers are assigned based on the number of symptoms present and the degree to which they impair functioning. For example, mild MDD is present if the minimum number of criteria is met, functional ability is not significantly disrupted, and impairment is small but controllable. Moderate and severe MDD are present when more symptoms are endorsed, symptoms are increasingly distressing, and impairment is significant. Recurrent episodes of <span id="ITerm10">MDD</span> may be present if criteria are met for subsequent episodes occurring at least 2 months apart. MDD <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">with psychosis</em> can also occur in which someone experiences hallucinations and/or delusions in addition to symptoms of MDD. Psychosis during MDD is usually a sign of severity of the presentation. Remission status is based on the number of criteria present following diagnosis of MDD; specifically, one is in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">partial remission</em> if symptoms have decreased or been absent for less than 2 months and in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">full remission</em> in the event of a 2-month period of symptom absence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm11">MDD</span> can further be associated with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mixed, melancholic,</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">atypical features</em>; anxious distress; catatonia; peripartum occurrence (referred to as postpartum depression); mood-congruent or incongruent features; or seasonal onset (referred to as seasonal affective disorder) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). These specifiers allow for recognition of symptoms occurring on a continuum, situational onset, and allow for more detailed assessment of the additional symptoms (e.g., anxious distress can lead to further assessment of anxiety symptoms; Sachdev et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR53" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">The prevalence rates of the features identified within these specifiers vary. <span id="ITerm12"/>Hasin et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>), for example, noted that the specifier for anxious/distressed was highest in their national sample, representing 74.6% of all those diagnosed with MDD, whereas the mixed features specifier was lower, characterizing 15.5% of those with MDD.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">According to the American Psychiatric Association (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>), the yearly prevalence of MDD is 7% and is highest among young adults and women, as typical onset occurs during puberty or adolescence. In a large US national study of <span id="ITerm13">MDD</span>, yearly prevalence rates were found to be slightly higher at 10.4% and lifetime prevalence rates of MDD were as high as 20.6% (Hasin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Cross-cultural prevalence rates vary slightly. For example, a systematic review including 63 articles across 29 countries found that lifetime prevalence of MDD ranged from 2% to 21%, with lowest prevalence in Asia and the highest in Europe. They also demonstrated higher rates of MDD among females (vs. males) (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR69" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>). Within the United States, the chronicity of MDD also varies by ethnicity, such that prevalence rates were lower in African-Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic groups than within white Americans (Hasin et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). Regarding the Hispanic or Latinx population, immigrants are less likely to experience depression than American-born Hispanic or Latinx individuals (Jackson-Triche et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>). However, it is important to note that symptoms of MDD may be underreported and under-detected in ethnic and racialized groups facing discrimination, and thus may be higher than what is noted in the literature (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par13"><span id="ITerm14">MDD</span> also differentially affects those within different settings. For example, relative to the general population, older adults living in nursing home or long-term care settings, patients in medical settings (especially those with chronic illness), and palliative care recipients are more likely to meet the criteria for MDD (Feliciano et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading">Persistent Depressive Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par14"><span id="ITerm15">Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)</span>, formerly known as <span id="ITerm16">Dysthymia</span>, reflects the combination of previous edition <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM</em> disorders, including dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). PDD symptom criteria require at least a two-year duration of consistently low mood as well as two additional symptoms related to changes in appetite, sleep, self-esteem, ability to concentrate, energy level, or the experience of hopelessness (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">6.1</a></span>). These symptoms cannot be absent for longer than 2 months throughout the depressive span, reflecting the chronicity of PDD. Further, during the period in which PDD occurs, it is possible for one to also meet the criteria for MDD (with persistent major depressive episode) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Like other mental disorders, the constellation of symptoms for PDD may not be the result of substances or physical or medical problems, be attributable to symptom profiles of other mental disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder), nor may there be evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes. The client must never have met symptom criteria for cyclothymic disorder, in which depressive and hypomanic episodes are present within a two-year period. Lastly, symptoms of PDD must cause personal distress or significantly affect one’s ability to function in important life arenas. Similar to MDD, PDD)<span id="ITerm17"/> can be qualified with specifiers, severity ratings, remission level, age of onset, and degree of presence of MDEs (e.g., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">persistent, intermittent</em>; APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">According to the APA (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>), the annual prevalence rate of PDD is low, estimated at 0.5–1.5% of adults and with higher lifetime prevalence rates of up to 30% in the United States and Canada. However, prevalence rates vary by country and culture. A survey from the World Mental Health Organization of community-dwelling adults across)<span id="ITerm18"/> 14 countries placed the prevalence rates of PDD at about 12% (Kessler et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>). In <span id="ITerm19">contrast, </span>Vandeleur et al.

With regard to specifiers, the lifetime prevalence of PDD was estimated at 15.2% with persistent MDE; 0.4% with intermittent MDE; and 2.5% with pure <span id="ITerm20">dysthymia</span> (Vandeleur et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>).</p></section>

PMDD (previously named late luteal phase dysphoric disorder) has a contentious history and was previously classified as a depressive disorder not otherwise specified given its need for more research; see Zachar and Kendler (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR680" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>) for a brief history and overview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">The core feature of PMDD involves changes in mood, ranging from sadness to anxiety to irritability, which begins the week before menses and gradually remits by the week following menses (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).

Clinicians should include a specifier regarding symptom onset (e.g., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">during intoxication</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">withdrawal</em>) and use the diagnostic code associated with the corresponding substance and the degree of substance use disorder (e.g., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mild, moderate, severe</em>, or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absent</em>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Among individuals with substance use disorders, the lifetime prevalence rate of alcohol- and stimulant-induced depressive episodes was 40%, while the lifetime prevalence of substance−/medication-induced depressive disorders was 0.26% among those without a history of non-substance-induced depressive <span id="ITerm26">disorders</span> (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Longitudinal research indicates that with many substances there is a bidirectional relationship between substance use and depression, such that use of the substance(s) leads to an increased risk for depression and the converse is also true. For example, substances like cannabis may increase the risk of developing a depressive disorder among adolescents and adults, particularly in heavy users or those with chronic use patterns (Langlois et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR71" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). Similarly, depressive disorders increase the risk for the use of substances like cannabis, perhaps as a coping strategy for managing symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">Given recent legalization of cannabis in many countries, including parts of the United States and Canada, there has been increased interest in the relationship between cannabis use and onset of mood <span id="ITerm27">disorders</span>. Prevalence rates of cannabis-induced depressive disorders are less clear as much of the research reports rates of comorbid MDD in those who use cannabis and are noted to be higher than the general population (25%) or predict risk for future depression diagnosis (MDD or bipolar disorder diagnosis) (Botsford et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">The risk for suicide differs depending on the type of substance used. Individuals with comorbid depressive disorders and alcohol use disorders have a higher risk of suicide attempts, whereas those with cannabis use disorders seem to have lower rates of suicide (Langlois et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR71" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>). As such, it is crucial to address substance/medication-induced depressive disorder in individuals with alcohol and substance use disorders.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</h3><p class="Para" id="Par26">Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is diagnosed in the event that a physical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, hypothyroidism, traumatic brain injury) is directly responsible for depressive symptoms. This diagnosis should be qualified with specifiers (e.g., whether or not MDE is present) and accompanied by the name of the specific physiological condition present (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading">Other Specified Depressive Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder</h3><p class="Para" id="Par27">In earlier versions of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM</em>, the Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified diagnosis was given when clinicians wanted to capture depressive conditions that did not meet the full criteria for any other depressive disorder or were provisional based on limited assessment information. In the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em>, this category was eliminated and replaced by two options: other specified depressive <span id="ITerm28">disorder</span> and unspecified depressive disorder. The diagnoses of Other Specified Depressive Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder may be assigned when a client presents with depressive symptoms that are <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">subclinical</em>, that is the symptoms substantially affect functioning but full criteria for a depressive disorder are not present. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em> describes three examples of conditions that would fit under this category including <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">recurrent brief depression, short-duration depressive episode</em>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">depressive episode with insufficient symptoms</em>. Recurrent brief depression would refer to the presence of depressed mood and at least four of the eight additional depressive symptoms that are brief in nature (e.g., last 2–13 days) but recur over at least 1 year (i.e., 12 consecutive months). The person must experience distress or impairment in function. Short-duration depressive episode also refers to a condition in which there is a depressed mood and at least four additional symptoms; however, the symptoms and associated distress or impaired functioning only last for 4–13 days. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms refers to a situation in which a depressed mood is present and at least one additional depressive symptom with concomitant distress or impaired function for at least 14 days. In these examples, the person would not meet the criteria for any other depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorder during the specified timeframes.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Unspecified Depressive Disorder is assigned if the clinician opts not to include information for why the depressive symptoms and associated distress or impairment do not meet the threshold for another more specific depressive disorder. This may occur in settings in which additional information necessary to make a more specific diagnosis is lacking as in the case of an emergency room (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) or within a co-visit with a medical provider in an integrated care setting.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><p class="Para" id="Par29">Gathering information for the assessment of depressive disorders is most often a dynamic process that involves integrating data from both informal and formal assessment methods. Given the range of available methods for assessing depressive disorders, it is crucial to consider the context of assessment (e.g., primary care, inpatient clinical settings, research), purpose of assessment (i.e., screening, diagnosis, treatment planning), and social and cultural contexts when selecting how to gather information. Although informal assessment methods are the most used strategy for gathering information in a clinical setting, mental health practitioners often integrate screening measures and clinical interviews in gathering data on depressive disorders.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec11"><h3 class="Heading">Screening Measures</h3><p class="Para" id="Par30">Standardized <span id="ITerm29">screening measures</span> are validated, approachable, and cost-effective tools for identifying those who may be at risk of developing a depressive disorder. These measures are often brief and require a limited amount of training to administer, making them ideal for use in primary care and other general health and social service settings. In fact, given the high prevalence of depressive disorders in the general population, it is now recommended that screening for depressive disorders should occur for all adults (including pregnant and postpartum persons, and older adults) in primary care settings and mental health intakes (US Preventive Services Task Force, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Generally, screening measures use self-report or informant-report to assess presenting symptoms and their associated frequency, severity, and duration with the intention of identifying individuals who may need further assessment using structured, semi-structured, or unstructured interview methods.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">The most common <span id="ITerm30">screening measures</span> for depressive disorders are self-report measures. Typically, an individual is asked to indicate the presence and severity of specific symptoms over an identified period of time (e.g., over the last 2 weeks). The inventory is then scored by a clinician, and the individual’s score on the instrument reflects the severity of the disorder. The Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>) and Two-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2; Arroll et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>) are among the most used and validated screening instruments for depressive disorders in the general adult population (Maurer et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). These assessments take approximately 1–5 min to complete and score, are openly available in multiple languages, and show high sensitivity and specificity (Kroenke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR72" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a></span>). Other commonly used self-report screening measures of depressive symptoms across the lifespan include: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">1977</a></span>), EQ-5D (The EuroQol Group, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR60" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a></span>), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self-Report (QIDS-SR; Rush et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR52" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>), and the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms, expanded version (IDAS-II; Watson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR64" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Some self-report measures have been designed for use with specific populations, such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Yesavage et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR67" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a></span>) and the Beck Depression Inventory—Primary Care (BDI-PC; Beck et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>). These inventories are thought to be more valid for use with older adults and medical patients respectively, due to a decreased emphasis on items related to somatic symptoms which tend to be more frequently endorsed in these populations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">Clinician-administered <span id="ITerm31">screening measures</span> are also common in research settings, although they are less common in clinical settings due to time restrictions. These instruments include: The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; Hamilton, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a></span>), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery &amp; Asberg, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a></span>), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Clinician-rated (IDS-CR; Rush et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR51" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a></span>). Often considered the “gold standard” in clinician-administered screening measures, the 21-item version of the HRSD takes approximately 20–30 min to administer and has been well validated with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81 and 0.88) (Carmody et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>). The MADRS is an excellent alternative to the HRSD as it is briefer (10 items, 20 min to administer), reported to be more sensitive to tracking clinical change in symptoms, is unifactorial, and has higher internal consistency ratings and inter-rater reliability (>0.90; Montgomery &amp; Asberg, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR45" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">There are also clinician-report and informant-report screening measures that are designed for use in individuals with cognitive impairment. Importantly, depression is more prevalent in the early stages of cognitive impairment, typically when the individual still maintains insight or awareness of their cognitive decline and symptoms (e.g., forgetting, losing track of conversations) and is often <span id="ITerm32">detected</span> using the typical screening measures reported above. However, depression may still be present in later stages, although often more difficult to detect. Thus, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD; Alexopoulos et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a></span>) may be completed by a clinician in conjunction with another person with sufficient knowledge of the identified patient (e.g., administered directly to a caregiver, or significant other). During the CSDD, 19 items are evaluated on a 3-point rating scale, with higher scores being indicative of higher severity of depression. The CSDD has adequate inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.67), good internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.84), and concurrent validity with the HRSD (Alexopoulos et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a></span>).</p><div class="Para" id="Par35"><span id="ITerm33">Screening measures</span> differ on how frequently the measure should be administered, the symptoms covered, the number of and format of the questions, the amount of time necessary to administer, and the availability of the inventories (see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">6.2</a></span> for examples). The drawback to using screening measures is that they are often not able to fully assess the degree of impairment and nuances of the depressive symptoms. In addition, they tend to be more inclusive (i.e., more sensitive than specific) and therefore result in more false positives than other methods of assessment. For these reasons, screening measures should never be used in place of a thorough diagnostic workup in making a definitive diagnosis.<div class="Table" id="Tab2"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 6.2</span><p class="SimplePara">Comparison of self-report screening <span id="ITerm34">measures</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/><col class="tcol4 align-left"/><col class="tcol5 align-left"/><col class="tcol6 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Measure</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Time frame assessed</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Symptoms covered</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Format of questions</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Time to administer</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Validated for ages</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">1.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec12"><h3 class="Heading">Clinical Interviews</h3><p class="Para" id="Par36">In clinical settings, unstructured clinical interviews are the most frequently used strategy for gathering information on depressive disorders. During an unstructured clinical interview, the clinician or mental health practitioner asks the individual open-ended questions regarding their current mood, specific symptoms, and frequency and intensity of these symptoms. These interviews also allow an exploration of family, medical, and psychiatric history, as well as relevant social and cultural considerations in a way that is unique to the individual. Although rich in the information they gather, informal clinical interviewing strategies are unstandardized, and may be less reliable and comprehensive in their ability to recognize and assess comorbid conditions. For this reason, many clinicians use a mix of formal assessment (i.e., screening measures) and interviewing techniques to gather data on depressive symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">For diagnostic and research purposes, semi-structured and structured interviews are excellent tools to assist in confirming the presence of a depressive disorder. These interviews are administered by trained interviewers and serve as reliable and valid tools that allow for a more thorough evaluation and diagnosis of disorders compared to unstructured interviews. In a semi-structured interview, the interviewer is provided with a specific list of questions to be covered as well as the flexibility to ask follow-up questions to gain a complete picture of the individual and seek any clarification necessary for diagnosis. The most commonly used semi-structured interview for depressive disorders in English-speaking adults is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5; First et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The SCID-5 takes between 30 and 120 minutes to administer, includes modules for multiple diagnoses within the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em>, and shows moderate to high interrater reliability. There is also an abbreviated version, which takes 30 min to administer (Quick Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, QuickSCID-5; First et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>) and a version for research purposes (The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Research Version (DSM-5-RV, First et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). For children and children and adolescents (6–18 years old), the most used semi-structured diagnostic interview is the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS; Kaufman &amp; Schweder, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>). In older adults (60+ years), the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>) is commonly used.</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">Structured interviews contain a set number of questions to be asked in a set order. Because of their format, these <span id="ITerm35">types</span> of interview tools provide a standardized process for gathering information, which can improve consistency in service delivery, reliability in diagnosis, and provide a means for tracking clinical outcomes/change indicators (Segal &amp; Williams, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). In addition, structured interviews decrease the need for extensive training of interviewers. However, some of these interviews are time-consuming and may not be practical in clinical settings. Once a depressive disorder diagnosis is confirmed, a clinician-administered measure such as the HRSD (Hamilton, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a></span>) may be more useful for tracking outcomes (Joiner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). The other disadvantage to fully structured interviews is a lack of flexibility in questioning. If a question is not fully answered or explained well, the interviewer is not allowed to deviate from the prescribed set of questions as it would lead to a decrease in reliability and validity of the norms. The most commonly used structured and semi-structured interviews are discussed in more detail in Chap. <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="106097_6_En_2_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource">2</span></a></span> of this volume.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Importantly, gathering information on <span id="ITerm36">depressive disorders</span> is not limited to research and diagnostic purposes, and depressive symptoms should be assessed throughout treatment to monitor maintenance and change over time. To do this, clinicians can use a severity measure or have the client use a data sheet to self-monitor depressive symptoms (e.g., daily mood log) or engagement in pleasurable events (e.g., weekly activity log). Because self-report is subjective, can be biased, or otherwise inaccurate (relies on memory and adequate perceptions of events), direct observation of the client may also be useful in tracking outcomes. These observations can occur within a session by the clinician (e.g., observation of a person’s grooming, hygiene, psychomotor activity) or out of session by a significant other (e.g., collateral data). Regardless of the method chosen, tracking outcomes can provide evidence as to accurate diagnosis of the condition, provide information for treatment planning, and allow for evaluation of treatment effectiveness.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec13"><h2 class="Heading">Recommendations for Formal Assessment</h2><p class="Para" id="Par40">The first step in comprehensive assessment of depressive disorders is integrating screening into clinical, primary care, research, and other social services settings (US Preventive Services Task Force, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR61" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). By reaching as many individuals as possible with screening, more comprehensive assessment can then be provided to those who may benefit from it. It is recommended that a structured clinical interview, supplemented by well-validated and reliable self-report instruments to measure symptom severity, is the best start for assessing depressive disorder diagnoses (Joiner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). In this manner, both clinician ratings and client reports are adequately considered. In addition, the APA released the third edition of guidelines on psychiatric evaluation in adults, supporting the use of such quantitative assessment tools. They note that while the field has yet to come to a complete consensus on adoption, these tools may help clinicians conduct reliable and thorough assessment of patients’ symptoms, which may then prevent potentially relevant symptoms from being overlooked (Silverman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec14"><h2 class="Heading">Case Illustrations</h2><p class="Para" id="Par41">Within this section, we present two cases to illustrate the assessment of depressive disorders. The first case represents a thorough, formal assessment of mood, medical, cognitive, and psychosocial history. This type of assessment is ideal, conducted in specialty behavioral health settings. The second case illustrates the shift toward brief collaborative care interventions delivered in primary care and other health and social service settings (Crowley et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). In these settings, the emphasis is on rapid assessment of mood symptoms, collaborative treatment planning, and ongoing symptom monitoring and response.</p><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar1"><div class="Heading">Case I: Older Adult from a Minoritized Group with Major Depressive Disorder</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par42">The client was a 71-year-old, divorced, Hispanic-American woman who presented with complaints of lifetime depression. The intake assessment included assessment of her current and past history of psychiatric symptoms, alcohol and substance use, suicidal ideation and behaviors, and medical and treatment history using the SCID. The SCID was supplemented with a depression severity measure (HRSD) and a mental status exam. Because the client also endorsed some subjective memory complaints, the intake assessment also included a brief neuropsychological battery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">At intake, careful attention was given to developing rapport and explaining the reason for assessment and for questions that were asked about her psychiatric and family history. The client reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of MDD, including depressed mood all day experienced daily, fatigue, and disrupted and restless sleep (occasional difficulties falling asleep but waking frequently and sometimes taking 1–3 h to fall back to sleep). She stated that she cried frequently, was lonely, and had few social supports. She reported being self-critical (about her weight and cleanliness/clutter of her home), feeling worthless and guilty over things that she had done or not done. She believed that she had brought the depression on herself and wondered why she didn’t take better care of herself. She also reported a loss of interest and pleasure in things that she used to enjoy and felt that she had to push herself to do anything, reporting “having nothing to look forward to.” She also reported feeling discouraged and pessimistic about the future (e.g., saw her future as “bleak”) and would probably have to continue working for “years to come.” When asked how she thinks things will work out, she stated that she will “probably be alone the rest of my life.” A review of her psychiatric history revealed that she had struggled with depression on and off for most of her life. Her medical history was notable for a total hip replacement and a left knee replacement several years prior, and her family history was unremarkable for psychiatric disorders.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">In addition to depressive symptoms, the client reported several psychosocial stressors including worry about finances, problems at work (conflict with supervisor), and worry about physical health. However, these did not appear to be excessive given her current financial situation (i.e., low income) and history of medical problems. She denied current suicidal ideation, hallucinations, and delusions. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Her mental status exam was notable for psychomotor retardation, somewhat blunted affect, and negative thought. She described her mood as “sad” and was preoccupied with worry over cognitive complaints including difficulties concentrating at work, making decisions, and difficulty remembering medications and dates. She reported concerns about her finances and health. On exam, she also met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">At the conclusion of the assessment, this client was diagnosed with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate</em>. In addition to depressive symptoms, she reported psychosocial stressors including worry about finances, problems at work (conflict with supervisor), and worry about physical health. Despite this report, her symptoms did not indicate a diagnosis of a comorbid anxiety disorder or anxious distress specifier, as her worry seemed commensurate to her situation, and she denied that the worry was causing distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning. Given her neuropsychological test results, the client also received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. The treatment plan focused on depressive symptoms and utilized problem-solving therapy techniques, which has empirical evidence for its value with older adults experiencing depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment (Kiosses &amp; Alexopoulos, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">The case is illustrative of some of the issues related to working with a diverse older adult. For example, careful attention was given to the development of rapport and reducing stigma associated with reporting mental health symptoms. The interviewer was attentive to the client’s biopsychosocial concerns and took care to use the client’s preferred language for discussing depressive symptoms, in attempts to create an atmosphere of caring and comfort to assist the client with the assessment process.</p></div><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Case II: Patient in Primary Care with Depressive Symptoms</div><p class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par48">The patient was a 56-year-old White woman who was screened as part of the primary care clinic’s routine screening procedures during a clinic visit for medical complaints. Screening included the PHQ-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7). Her scores indicated moderately severe depression and moderate anxiety symptoms. She denied suicidal ideation based on the last item of the PHQ-9. A brief psychosocial assessment was conducted, and she reported significant distress due to caring for her mother with <span id="ITerm37">Alzheimer’s disease</span> and helping other family members (adult child, grandchildren), all of whom lived with her. In the absence of subjective memory complaints, no formal cognitive assessment was given. The intervention was guided by a brief version of behavioral activation for depression (Gum et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), with a flexible number of sessions and follow-up telephone calls based on how well she engaged in behavioral goals she set and her PHQ-9 scores. To assess treatment response, the PHQ-9 was administered during each encounter and discussed with her. She initially had difficulty completing behavioral goals she set for herself, but with attention to barriers and problem-solving efforts, she gradually began to complete more goals between encounters. The PHQ-9 improved to the non-depressed range by the last encounter.</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">This case is an example of using brief screening tools to identify patients in distress, develop collaborative treatment plans with the patient, and monitor treatment response over time. There was less attention given to formal diagnosis. If the patient had not shown improvement, then referral to a specialty behavioral health setting would have been warranted, where more thorough formal assessment and interventions would have been provided.</p></div></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec15"><h2 class="Heading">Impact of Gender, Race, Culture, Age, and Other Aspects of Diversity</h2><p class="Para" id="Par50">Multiple dimensions of diversity impact the assessment of depressive disorders, including race and ethnicity, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and age. A thorough review of diagnostic considerations for each diverse group is beyond the scope of this chapter; rather, the focus is on general considerations and strategies. Moreover, there are significant individual differences within groups that require a flexible, individualized approach to diagnostic interviewing. The individual’s background likely impacts the assessment process from the first encounter, as the clinician strives to build trust, rapport, and socialize the individual to the assessment process. As the assessment progresses, the client’s background may influence how symptoms are reported, observed, and conceptualized, for which the clinician needs to consider the validity of standardized assessment tools being used and additional cultural factors to assess. Finally, depressive symptoms occur in the context of other biopsychosocial considerations, which inform the clinician’s case conceptualization and treatment planning.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec16"><h3 class="Heading">Rapport Building and Education About the Assessment Process</h3><p class="Para" id="Par51">The next section primarily focuses on rapport building in the clinical interviewing and assessment process relating to older adult and minoritized populations. Specifically, older adults (60+ years) enter mental health assessments with a wide range of perceptions about themselves, their environments, the presenting problems, and their providers and healthcare settings. Compared to younger adults, older adults face unique barriers to mental health services, such as lower mental health literacy (i.e., the ability to identify mental health problems and treatments according to the dominant conceptualizations) (Adams et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>) and aging stigma (Allen &amp; Sikora, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a></span>). Concerns about stigma are common in older adults in general; however, they may be more pronounced for older adults who are also part of minoritized racial, ethnic, and sexual groups (Inventor et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In any diverse population, lower mental health literacy and stigma may impact the assessment of depressive disorders in rapport building between the clinician and client, and in symptom reporting in multiple ways, including rapport building and symptom reporting (i.e., whether symptoms are reported and how they are described).</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">Three strategies during the initial rapport-building phase may mitigate these concerns and maximize information gathering with older adults and diverse groups: (1) carefully informing the client of the purpose of the assessment and what to expect during the assessment process, (2) reducing stigma through empathetic responses, and (3) practicing cultural humility and maintaining cultural competence to facilitate the rapport-building process. First, it is important to ascertain the clients’ understanding of why they are seeing the clinician and to provide them with all relevant information about the purpose of the assessment. Similarly, the interviewer should inform clients about what to expect, such as length of the assessment, types of information that will be sought, rationale for the information being asked of the client, from whom information will be sought (including gathering appropriate permissions), and how the assessment results will be used and reported back to the client. Some clients may be concerned about the outcomes of the assessment (e.g., hospitalization, competency or legal issues) or concerned about the protection of their confidentiality, so the clinician needs to carefully discuss the potential outcomes of the assessment and what information will be shared with whom.</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">Stigma concerns may be reduced by empathizing with the client’s symptoms or situation, viewing distress as common or understandable in some difficult situations. For example, while assessing mood symptoms with an older caregiver who has recently placed their partner in a long-term care facility, the clinician may note that caregivers often feel guilty, worrying that they “didn’t do enough,” thus normalizing and recognizing the difficult emotions involved in caregiving and role transitions. This may allow the caregiver to further open up more about experiences of guilt as well as other depressive symptoms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Finally, practicing cultural humility may increase alliance in the clinician-client relationship and further facilitate an open discussion about depressive symptoms and assessment. Broadly, cultural humility is an evolving process including self-examining one’s own cultural awareness, providing interpersonal respect, addressing power imbalances, and an openness to new cultural information (Mosher et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Research indicates that clinicians who adopt a framework of cultural humility experience stronger therapeutic relationships and are less likely to encounter or contribute to microaggressions when working with diverse clients (Davis et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>), highlighting the importance of considering diversity factors in all assessment interactions. Of note, cultural humility involves acknowledging all sources of individual diversity, including (but not limited to): race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or values.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec17"><h3 class="Heading">Use of Standardized Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par55">Standardized diagnostic and screening tools that have been validated for diverse populations are a critical component of diagnostic interviewing. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide a comprehensive review of all potential measures, it is critical to examine the evidence of validity with diverse populations prior to selecting measures. Some tools have become well-established with diverse populations. For example, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>) has shown very good validity in relation to expert clinician interviews and has been used with a wide range of samples, including primary care and other medical patients, individuals from various cultural backgrounds (e.g., diverse populations within the United States, including Latinx and African-American; Nigerian; Thai; Korean; Chinese) (Huang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>), and older adults (Phelan et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR48" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec18"><h3 class="Heading">Supplementing Standardized Assessment with a Cultural Formulation</h3><p class="Para" id="Par56">Despite the value of standardized tools, the individual’s cultural context must be considered while formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan. Cultural context is important to assess, given that clients’ culture impacts all aspects of their help-seeking, including their perceptions of their problems, causes, and potential solutions, and their relationships with providers. It is also important that clinicians recognize that cultural identity is complex and may change over time. For example, a client may strongly identify with both their country of origin and the majority culture in which they live in, or they may identify with neither, with not clear relationship between the two. Instead of assuming a “zero-sum model,” in which the person is viewed as high on one dimension of identity and low on the other, a client may have a low or high sense of identity on each dimension. Immigration status is another important part of cultural identity that may impact distress and stressors. For example, research has shown that the rate of depression in immigrant individuals is lower than that of native-born individuals when they arrive in the United States, but that their risk for psychological distress increases with time spent in the United States (Ikonte et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par57">Cultural factors also influence how individuals conceptualize and report their mood symptoms. For example, Hispanic-American adults tend to emphasize somatic symptoms more so than emotional or mood-related symptoms, and are less likely to distinguish between mood and somatic symptoms (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). A similar pattern has been found with older adults, who may present with more somatic symptoms, including a focus on physical health conditions, agitation, or gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as more anhedonia and fewer depressed or mood-focused symptoms (Hegeman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>). Individuals may also use terms of descriptions not found within the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em> to label their symptoms. For example, Spanish-speaking patients may use a variety of terms to describe their distress or depressive symptoms, such as “desanimado” (discouraged) or “nervios” (Noguera et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR47" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a></span>). There are also mixed findings on whether Black Americans experience more or less depression as compared to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts, suggesting that the relationship between race and depression is multi-dimensional, and accurate assessment should include assessing for social context, lived experiences (such as systemic racism and discrimination), and individual descriptions of depressive symptoms (Ettman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Thus, in assessing and diagnosing depressive disorders, clinicians would use a biopsychosocial conceptualization, validate reported somatic symptoms, and maintain cultural competence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">To introduce a simplified approach for integrating cultural considerations into assessment across disciplines, the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) was published in 2013 (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The CFI is a semi-structured interview, which was developed based on literature review and field trials in the United States, Canada, India, Kenya, the Netherlands, and Peru. It includes 16 core questions to systematically assess four dimensions: cultural identity of the individual (e.g., reference group, acculturation across host and origin cultures, language), cultural explanations of illness (e.g., idioms and symptom presentation, meaning of illness in relation to cultural norms, perceived explanatory models), cultural factors related to psychosocial environment and levels of functioning (e.g., interpretations of stressors, social networks), and cultural elements of the client-clinician relationship (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). In addition, the CFI includes 12 supplemental modules that can be used to gather more information; the modules for older adults, immigrants and refugees, and caregivers might be particularly relevant for assessment with diverse older adults and their families. The questions are open-ended, and the authors conceptualize the CFI as a person-centered, ethnographic approach that allows patients to describe their problems, explanations, and experiences in their own words.</p><p class="Para" id="Par59">The CFI begins by asking about the patient’s (or informant’s) perspective regarding the presenting problem, its causes, helpful supports, and stressors that make the problem worse. The next set of questions asks about the patient’s cultural identity and how it relates to their problems. Subsequent questions ask about coping strategies the patient has tried and how the patient has sought help (formal or informal) from others. The final questions ask about preferences for future assistance and any concerns or observations the patient has about their relationship with the clinician. The questions are written in plain language, with instructions that there is no “right” answer, and include definitions for some terms.</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">Adding the CFI or other questions to assess cultural considerations is a valuable supplement to the standard diagnostic assessment tools, even those that have been validated with diverse populations. Research has provided evidence that the CFI is effective in improving clinical rapport (Lewis-Fernández et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a></span>), as well as assisting clinicians with differential diagnosis and treatment planning with diverse populations (Aggarwal, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>). In addition, assessing patients’ multidimensional needs, such as housing, environment, physical, and social needs, also helps the clinician gain a better understanding of the full scope of a client’s presenting problem and how their needs may relate to symptoms of depressive disorders.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec19"><h3 class="Heading">Biopsychosocial Assessment</h3><p class="Para" id="Par61">Individuals from underserved populations frequently have complex, multidimensional problems associated with a depressive disorder. Such problems may include physical illness and limitations, limited income, poor social support networks, and unsafe or unstable housing <span id="ITerm38">situations</span>. These individuals also may view depressive symptoms in relation to these other difficulties, complicating the identification of symptoms. For example, a client who is unemployed and of low income may primarily discuss their concerns related to job-seeking, rather than their mood symptoms. Alternatively, an older adult may talk about their loneliness rather than depression. Thus, to fully explore depressive symptoms and develop a comprehensive treatment plan, the clinician needs to conduct an assessment of the clients’ multidimensional needs.</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Older adults with depression have been found to experience significantly more unmet needs across multiple domains (environmental, physical, psychological, social) compared to older adults without depression (Stein et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), underscoring the importance of supplementing mood evaluations with an assessment of other needs. In fact, addressing the multidimensional needs of older <span id="ITerm39">adults</span> who have low income and depressive symptoms with thorough case management may be sufficient for alleviating depressive symptoms, without psychotherapy or other interventions for depression (Areán et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>), which has important implications for treatment planning.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec20"><h3 class="Heading">Adjusting Assessment Procedures</h3><p class="Para" id="Par63">In addition to assessing a client’s multidimensional needs, the interviewer may need to adjust the assessment process to accommodate these needs. For example, the clinician may need to be flexible regarding time of day and location for meeting, such as if the client has other responsibilities such as work or caregiving, is dependent on others for transportation, or has physical or sensory limitations that limit the ability to travel to certain clinical settings. For a client with communication difficulties, the clinician may want to consider multimodal communication strategies, such as written cues or oral administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires. For a client with physical limitations, the clinician should inquire about the client’s best time of day and may need to schedule breaks or assessments across multiple time periods.</p></section>
</section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec21"><h2 class="Heading">Information Critical to Making a Diagnosis</h2><p class="Para" id="Par64">In addition to the above-mentioned considerations when making a diagnosis for a depressive disorder, it is also important to differentiate among possible diagnoses and use specifiers. To do this accurately, it is crucial to be aware of comorbid mental health conditions, medication side effects that mimic depressive symptoms, and other medical conditions that may be comorbid or differentiated from depressive disorders.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec22"><h3 class="Heading">Differential Diagnosis of a Depressive Disorder Versus Other Mental Disorders</h3><p class="Para" id="Par65">The importance of differential diagnosis cannot be understated. Accurate diagnosis impacts the clinician’s ability to prescribe and deliver appropriate treatments and to predict clinical outcomes. Whereas the presence of manic or hypomanic episodes may appear to easily differentiate <span id="ITerm40">unipolar</span> and bipolar disorders, the distinction may not always be so readily apparent when assessing an individual. One challenge relates to the issue of self-reported mood. It can be difficult to differentiate between a “normal good mood” that may occur during remission of MDD or PDD versus an “unusually high or elevated mood” that occurs during a manic or hypomanic episode in bipolar disorder. For example, with chronic MDD or PDD, the person may have felt unusually down or depressed for such a long period of time that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any</em> increase in mood may seem unusually high. In this case, the person may respond positively to questions designed to capture mania (e.g., person required less sleep than usual because their “usual” during the chronic depression was 10 or more hours of sleep).</p><p class="Para" id="Par66">A second difficulty in differentiation has to do with determining the difference between the self-reported atypical or irritable symptoms in MDD and the irritable mood that occurs with bipolar disorders, which may be qualitatively different, but unclear to the child/adolescent or adult who has never experienced both. Fortunately, these symptoms are not the sole criteria upon which to base a diagnosis. Careful questioning and eliciting examples can provide necessary detail to assist in determining if the self-reported description of “elevated” or “irritable” mood meets the criteria for abnormal functioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par67">In addition, a number of additional symptoms should be considered before a definitive diagnosis is made. For example, people with MDD tend to desire more or better sleep, whereas individuals with bipolar disorders report less of a desire or need for sleep and are often doing some activity during normal sleeping hours (Joiner et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a></span>). Other factors that suggest the possibility of bipolar instead of unipolar depression include worse cognitive functioning (Gildengers et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>), family history of bipolarity, and a higher number of past mood episodes (Angst et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par68">Another difficulty in differentiation has to do with overlapping symptoms. For example, individuals with anxiety disorders, alcohol and substance use disorders, or bipolar disorder commonly report feelings of sadness and hopelessness (Tebeka et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR59" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>), which are hallmark symptoms of depressive disorders in adults. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) allows for recognition of these anxious symptoms in terms of using a specifier, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">with anxious distress</em> to denote the expression of at least 2 of 5 anxiety symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrating, fear of something bad happening) occurring during most days of either an MDE or PDD. However, the presence of both depressive and anxiety symptoms complicates the diagnostic picture in terms of which symptoms appeared first or are primary. What is clear is that when these symptoms are comorbid, the prognosis is poor (e.g., longer duration of symptoms, more suicidal ideation, poorer treatment response) (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><div class="Para" id="Par69">Similarly, it is important to rule out any medical diagnoses that present with symptoms that are similar to depressive disorders (e.g., fatigue, weight fluctuations, changes in sleep may occur with cancer or untreated diabetes (See Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3">6.3</a></span> for examples of medical disorders with symptoms similar to depressive disorders). It is also crucial to assess for medication use that may impact depressive symptoms.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec23"><h3 class="Heading">Use of Specifiers</h3><p class="Para" id="Par70">The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5-TR</em> (APA, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) utilizes a number of standard specifiers to describe the clinical status of the most recent mood episode and the course of the disorder. The first type of specifiers describes symptom features of the mood episode: with anxious distress, with mixed features, with melancholic features, with atypical features, with psychotic features (mood-congruent or mood-incongruent), with catatonia, with peripartum onset, and with seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">With anxious distress</em> was added in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DSM-5</em> in recognition of the common co-occurrence of anxious symptoms with depressive or manic/hypomanic episodes. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">With mixed features</em> is used when the person meets criteria for one type of mood episode (depressive or manic/hypomanic) and displays at least three symptoms of the other types of episode, without meeting full criteria. <span id="ITerm42"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Melancholic features</em></span> refer to a person who is unresponsive to pleasant or pleasurable stimuli, who tends to experience depression as being worse in the morning, and who reports excessive feelings of guilt. <span id="ITerm43"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Atypical features</em></span> of depression include what is referred to as “mood reactivity,” that is, temporary lightening of mood in response to positive events, and the presence of at least two of the following: increased appetite or weight gain, hypersomnia (greater than 10 h of sleep per day), feeling as if the arms or legs are weighed down (leaden paralysis), and extreme sensitivity to rejection in relationships. <span id="ITerm44"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Psychotic features</em></span> involve hallucinations or delusions and may be mood-congruent or incongruent. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">With catatonia</em> includes not responding, talking, or moving; or repetitive speech or movement. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">With peripartum onset</em> involves onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of giving birth. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">With seasonal pattern</em> refers to a pattern of recurrent episodes that occur only during specific times of year.</p><p class="Para" id="Par71">Based on a review (Sachdev et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR53" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>), three changes to the specifiers may have particular utility with older adults. Many older adults with depression also experience symptoms of anxiety; thus, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">with anxious distress</em> may better characterize these older adults. Similarly, older adults may be more stable in their moods, so <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">mixed features</em> may signify some kind of deterioration in the mood disorder or other possible medical condition. Third, depressed older adults are more likely to experience psychotic symptoms than younger ages, so it may be useful to use the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">psychotic features</em> specifier, which is no longer dependent on the severity of the depressive episode (Sachdev et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR53" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par72">Another type of specifier relates to the intensity or impact of symptoms on functioning and is referred to as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">severity</em> specifier. These specifiers include mild, moderate, or severe. The severity specifiers are discussed in more detail in the specific disorders section. Also, recovery can be characterized as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">full remission</em> such that the person is symptom free between the recurrent episodes or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">partial remission</em> of symptoms during the interepisode period.</p><p class="Para" id="Par73">Empirical research regarding the epidemiology and predictive value of the symptom specifiers appears to be limited for older adults. Characterizing the severity and course of the mood disorders, however, has important implications for treatment. Older adults with more severe depressive symptoms and younger age of onset are more likely to experience a chronic course (Comijs et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec25"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par87"><span id="ITerm45">Depressive disorders</span> are common, costly to the individual, family, and society, and are among the most widely studied mental disorders. The causes of depressive disorders are numerous and complex, including any number of biopsychosocial factors. Assessments of depression vary in the degree to which they account for these biopsychosocial factors in the type of items utilized and the thoroughness of the clinical interview.</p><p class="Para" id="Par88">Depression may present differently across individuals and settings, varying from brief episodes and subclinical presentations to more severe episodes and chronic symptomatology. Unfortunately, many people with depressive disorders are either untreated or poorly treated. Early identification through good clinical interviewing and assessment can help to identify people who could benefit from treatment and assist in delivering appropriate treatment. At the same time, it is important to follow brief screening with more thorough assessment before forming an official diagnosis. Ideally, assessment includes mood symptoms and functioning, as well as biopsychosocial needs assessment and a cultural formulation. Because of the multifaceted nature of depressive disorders, further research is necessary to aid in the ability to improve screening, diagnosis, and treatment, to better address these disorders and alleviate the distress and disability that accompany them.</p></section>
