Sexual dysfunctions consist of clinically significant issues with desire, interest, and arousal (e.g., erection), orgasm (including ejaculation), and genitopelvic pain and penetration, and they may be <span id="ITerm4">diagnosed</span><span id="ITerm5"/> as being due to the use of medications and/or substances. When more than one sexual dysfunction is present, all should be recorded (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). If the presence of a sexual dysfunction can be explained by comorbid nonsexual mental disorders, such as an anxiety or mood disorder, only the nonsexual disorder diagnosis (e.g., generalized anxiety) should be made (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In addition, the diagnosis of a sexual dysfunction requires ruling out sexual issues that are better explained by the effects of a medical condition or by severe relationship distress, partner violence, or other stressors (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><div class="Para" id="Par5">There are seven sexual dysfunctions (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">14.1</a></span>; refer to the DSM-5-TR for three other <span id="ITerm6">designations</span> [substance/medication-induced, other specified, and unspecified sexual dysfunction]) that are diagnosable when the problem is associated with significant distress and have been present for a minimum of approximately 6 months (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Subtypes are used to designate the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">onset</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">context</em>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">distress severity</em><span id="ITerm7"/>. In terms of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">onset</em>, “lifelong” refers to a sexual dysfunction that appears to have always been present, and “acquired” indicates that the sexual dysfunction developed after a period of non-problematic experiences. With respect to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">context</em>, sexual dysfunctions may be limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners (“situational”), whereas “generalized” dysfunctions are not. <span id="ITerm8"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Distress severity</em></span> (i.e., mild, moderate, severe) should be documented for all sexual dysfunctions except for premature (early) ejaculation, in which the severity subtype corresponds to the client’s estimate of ejaculatory latency during penetrative sexual activity (i.e., mild, 30–60 s; moderate, 15–30 s; severe, prior to or at the start of sexual activity, or within 15 s) (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In <span id="ITerm9">clinical </span><span id="ITerm10"/>settings, such accurate time-based distinctions for premature (early) ejaculation are rarely made; instead, general estimates (e.g., “before my erection,” “as soon as I am aroused,” “within a few seconds of penetration,” “within a minute or two after penetration”) are used to inform severity (Pukall &amp; Bergeron, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR56" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a></span>).<div class="Table" id="Tab1"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 14.1</span><p class="SimplePara">DSM-5-TR <span id="ITerm11">sexual </span>dysfunctions according to sex assigned at birth</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Sexual response cycle phase affected</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Males</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Females</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Desire/interest</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Hypoactive sexual desire disorder</p></td><td rowspan="2" style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Sexual interest/arousal disorder</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Excitement/arousal</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Erectile disorder</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Orgasm</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Delayed ejaculation</p><p class="SimplePara">Premature (early) ejaculation</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Orgasmic disorder</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td><td style="text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par6">Although not explicitly stated in the DSM-5-TR (but stated in some previous versions), sexual dysfunctions are based on the first three <span id="ITerm12">stages</span> of the four-phase sexual response cycle (Masters &amp; Johnson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR43" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a></span>): (1) desire/interest, which consists of fantasies about and the wish to engage in sexual activity; (2) excitement/arousal, which manifests as a subjective sexual pleasure and associated physiological changes (e.g., genital lubrication and engorgement); and (3) orgasm, which consists of the release of sexual tension and the rhythmic contractions of genitopelvic muscles and organs. A problem at any one stage of the sexual response cycle is likely to lead to difficulties with other stages; indeed, clinically, a high comorbidity among the sexual dysfunctions is observed. For example, a client presenting with orgasm difficulties may also experience problems with desire/interest. In addition, genitopelvic pain can potentially interfere with any or all aspects of sexual response. Although sound empirical data on comorbidities are lacking, a recent consensus paper concluded that comorbidity among sexual dysfunctions was more common among cis women than cis men (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">Although the DSM-5-TR has continued a <span id="ITerm13">long</span><span id="ITerm14"/> tradition that separates sexual dysfunctions into those that affect cis men and cis women—with some of them named in a gender/sex-specific <span id="ITerm15">manner</span> (e.g., male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder)—it specifies that the diagnostic criteria can be applied to people of any gender/sex given that they describe symptoms that are not gender/sex-dependent (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Furthermore, it specifies that any diagnosis referring to anatomy (e.g., genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to, for example, vaginal penetration and vulvovaginal pain) should be based on the client’s current anatomy and not on their sex assigned at birth (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Clinical judgment will play an important role in ensuring appropriate, relevant diagnoses are made for gender minority clients (individuals who are, for example, trans or non-binary), especially since research on sexual dysfunctions in this population is limited.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">Sexual desire and arousal disorders include male <span id="ITerm16">hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)</span>, <span id="ITerm17">erectile disorder (ED)</span>, and female <span id="ITerm18">sexual interest/arousal disorder (SIAD)</span>. The diagnosis of male <span id="ITerm19">HSDD</span><span id="ITerm20"/><span id="ITerm21"/> is made when a client describes persistent or recurrent deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Although the DSM-5 considers desire dysfunctions as distinct from arousal dysfunctions for men (i.e., there are separate diagnoses for HSDD and ED; Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">14.1</a></span>), this distinction is not made for women. Based on research indicating that women recognize a high degree of overlap in perceptions of sexual desire and arousal (Graham et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a></span>, this pattern is also true of men; Janssen et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a></span>), the DSM-5-TR includes the diagnosis of SIAD, which replaced the former diagnoses of female HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD). SIAD is characterized by at least three of the following: absent/reduced (1) interest in sexual activity; (2) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies; (3) sexual excitement/pleasure <span id="ITerm22">during </span>sexual <span id="ITerm23">activity</span><span id="ITerm24"/> in almost all or all (75–100%) sexual encounters; (4) sexual interest/arousal <span id="ITerm25">in</span> response to any internal or external sexual/erotic cues; and (5) genital/nongenital sensations during sexual activity (75–100% of encounters); and no/reduced initiation of sexual <span id="ITerm26">activity</span><span id="ITerm27"/><span id="ITerm28"/> and typically unreceptive to a partner’s attempts to initiate (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The prevalence of desire disorders in women is estimated to be between 15 and 55%—with rates of 40–50% in those aged 65 years and above—and between 15 and 25% in men (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). A diagnosis of ED is made when at least one of the following three symptoms are experienced on all or almost all (75–100%) sexual encounters: marked difficulty in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">obtaining</em> or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">maintaining</em> an erection, or a marked <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">decrease in erectile rigidity</em> (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). A wide range of prevalence rates is <span id="ITerm29">reported </span><span id="ITerm30"/><span id="ITerm31"/>for <span id="ITerm32">ED</span> (i.e., 15–76%) as rates vary with age; overall, the <span id="ITerm33">prevalence </span>rate of ED in the USA is 22% (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">Orgasmic disorders consist of <span id="ITerm34">female orgasmic disorder (FOD)</span>, and, in men, <span id="ITerm35">delayed ejaculation (DE)</span> and <span id="ITerm36">premature (early) ejaculation (PE)</span>. <span id="ITerm37">FOD</span><span id="ITerm38"/><span id="ITerm39"/> is characterized by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms (experienced in 75–100% of sexual encounters): marked delay in, marked <span id="ITerm40">infrequency </span><span id="ITerm41"/>of, or absence of orgasm; and markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). FOD is estimated to affect between 16 and 25% of women (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The diagnostic criteria for <span id="ITerm42">DE</span> consist of at least one of the following symptoms (experienced in 75–100% of sexual encounters), without desiring the delay: marked delay in ejaculation, and marked infrequency or absence of ejaculation (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The prevalence of DE is 1–10% (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). PE, which affects approximately 8–30% of men of all ages (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), is diagnosed when a patient describes a persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation experienced in 75–100% of partnered sexual encounters within approximately one minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. Note that these criteria can also be applied to nonvaginal penetration activities; however, <span id="ITerm43">specific </span><span id="ITerm44"/><span id="ITerm45"/>duration criteria have not yet been established for these activities (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm46">Genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD)</span><span id="ITerm47"/> is a <span id="ITerm48">sexual </span><span id="ITerm49"/>dysfunction that is currently restricted to individuals with female-typical genitopelvic anatomy; it affects between 14 and 27% of women (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>). The diagnosis of GPPPD involves persistent or recurrent difficulties with at least one of the following: (1) vaginal penetration during intercourse; (2) marked vulvovaginal/pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts; (3) marked fear/anxiety about vulvovaginal/pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration; and (4) marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Despite a large representation of research on genitopelvic pain in <span id="ITerm50">men</span><span id="ITerm51"/> and an estimated prevalence of 16.8% (McCabe et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR44" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), the DSM-5-TR states that new research on genitopelvic pain in men suggests that a similar dysfunction may be diagnosable in the future. In the meantime, the DSM-5-TR suggests using the diagnoses of an “other specified” or an “unspecified” sexual dysfunction for men <span id="ITerm52">with</span><span id="ITerm53"/> genitopelvic pain.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading">Gender Dysphoria</h3><div class="Para" id="Par11"><span id="ITerm54">Gender dysphoria (GD)</span>, <span id="ITerm55">the</span><span id="ITerm56"/> prevalence of which has been estimated to be between 0.1% and 1% (Byne et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>), is characterized by an individual’s affective/cognitive discontent (i.e., distress, dysphoria) that results from an incongruence between their experienced gender (i.e., the internal, psychological experience of their gender) and their assigned gender (i.e., how their gender is perceived by others based on their outward appearance) (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The person’s experienced gender may be binary (e.g., a person who was assigned female gender/sex at birth and identifies as a man/male) or non-binary (e.g., a person who was assigned female gender/sex at birth and who identifies as agender). Not all people who experience gender incongruence experience dysphoria or distress. The diagnosis is made when the dysphoria is experienced for a minimum of approximately six months and is associated with clinically significant distress or functional impairment. The following disorders also need to be ruled out: transvestic disorder (i.e., the distressing or impairing behavior of cross-dressing for the purpose of sexual excitement), body dysmorphic disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, or other clinical presentations (e.g., the desire to rid oneself of one’s penis for aesthetic reasons, which is rare) (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In addition, <span id="ITerm57">clinical guidelines</span> have been developed in response to the high co-occurrence between GD and autism spectrum disorder in adolescents (Strang et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR68" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). As the expression of GD varies with age, the DSM-5-TR includes <span id="ITerm58">separate </span>diagnostic criteria for children and adolescents/adults (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">14.2</a></span>). In children, the typical onset of cross-gender behaviors is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, with more frequent expressions of anatomic <span id="ITerm59">dysphoria </span><span id="ITerm60"/>as puberty approaches (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).<div class="Table" id="Tab2"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 14.2</span><p class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm61">Diagnostic features</span> for gender dysphoria in children and adolescents/adults</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Gender dysphoria in children</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">At least six of the following (including the first one, which is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">required</em> for diagnosis)</p><p class="SimplePara"> 1.

It distinguishes between a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">paraphilia</em> (generally defined as an atypical, intense, and persistent sexual interest) and a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">paraphilic disorder</em> (a paraphilia that causes distress or harm/risk of harm to others). There <span id="ITerm66">are</span> eight specified paraphilic disorders (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3">14.3</a></span>) and in each one, the specific focus of erotic interest (minimum duration of 6 months) is characterized in Criterion A, and any distress, impairment, or harm that this interest causes is captured in Criterion B. Should an individual meet solely the requirements for Criterion A, then a paraphilia is identified. However, if the elements of Criterion B are also met, then a paraphilic <span id="ITerm67">disorder </span>is diagnosed. This distinction reflects a line of thought in which an individual might harbor, for example, a sexual interest in children, in which case the presence of a paraphilia may be identified. However, it is only a paraphilic disorder if these feelings significantly impair the person’s ability to function or if these feelings are acted upon, causing harm (or the risk of harm). Note that it is possible for individuals to have multiple paraphilias/paraphilic disorders. In addition to specified paraphilias, the <span id="ITerm68">DSM-5-TR</span><span id="ITerm69"/> acknowledges a broad range of other paraphilias (e.g., necrophilic disorder), which are recorded as “other specified paraphilia disorder” when the nature of the atypical interest is clear and as “unspecified paraphilic disorder” when it is not.<div class="Table" id="Tab3"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 14.3</span><p class="SimplePara">The DSM-5-TR paraphilic disorders</p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Paraphilic disorders</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Criterion A (and other relevant information), as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

An exception is that pedophilic disorders cannot be declared to be in remission, which has fostered some debate (e.g., Briken et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). These specifiers were incorporated to reflect the potential for a person to greatly reduce the likelihood of acting on paraphilic interests, thereby countervailing distress, impairment, and the potential for harm. Under such conditions, the paraphilia remains but the paraphilic disorder is deemed to be in remission. The specifier regarding the presence of a controlled environment was included because many individuals who have acted on paraphilic <span id="ITerm71">interests</span> have restrictions on their liberty, thereby rendering it difficult to assess their ongoing tendencies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">With regard to the <span id="ITerm72">prevalence</span> of paraphilic disorders, the DSM-5-TR cautions that there is considerable uncertainty. It is <span id="ITerm73">estimated</span><span id="ITerm74"/> that the percentage of men who have acted on such paraphilic impulses is (at most) 12% for voyeuristic disorder, 2–4% for exhibitionistic disorder, 10–14% for frotteuristic disorder, and around 3–5% for pedophilic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). All rates are higher for men than women and sometimes substantially so. The reasons for this disparity are unclear, although sexual drive has been proposed as a mediator (Dawson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) and there is some suggestion that rates are somewhat higher for women than previously reported (Joyal &amp; Carpentier, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>).</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading">Procedures for Gathering Information</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec6"><h3 class="Heading">Sexual Dysfunctions</h3><p class="Para" id="Par16">The <span id="ITerm75">clinical interview</span> is the main technique with which to assess and diagnose sexual dysfunctions. There is no widely used, validated, standardized interview for sexual dysfunctions as is the case for many other DSM-5-TR disorders. However, several authors have proposed clinical interview guidelines and recommendations for coverage of topics and processes (e.g., Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">The clinical interview typically starts with the individual describing the nature of the problem and the reason for seeking treatment. Following an open-ended description of the problem, the clinician may ask more specific questions about when the problem started (onset), the conditions under which <span id="ITerm76">it </span><span id="ITerm77"/>occurs (context), and the extent of the problem and amount of distress experienced <span id="ITerm78">because </span>of the issue (severity). Questions can then be asked about the various biological, psychological, and social problems that might be implicated (Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). In terms of general biological factors, the clinician should assess and take into account age, general health status (e.g., body mass index), lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, cigarette smoking), hormone levels, chronic pain syndromes (e.g., chronic prostatitis syndrome, vulvodynia), hormone levels, and medical illnesses that affect vascular, sensory, central, and nervous system functions. In addition, questions regarding past surgeries and injuries, especially those in the genital or pelvic region, and past and current medications should be posed (Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). It is commonly understood that many medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and <span id="ITerm79">antihypertensives</span>, can detrimentally affect sexual functioning (Healy et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">With respect to individual <span id="ITerm80">psychological factors, depression and anxiety</span> are often comorbid with sexual dysfunction. If present and treatment does not target the associated mood disorders, treatment will likely not be successful. <span id="ITerm81">Substance abuse disorders</span> may also have a major negative impact on sexual functioning. Certain maladaptive cognitive sets, unrealistic expectations, misinformation or lack of information, and negative emotional reactions can also impinge upon sexual function. Past sexual trauma and other negative experiences may set the foundation for <span id="ITerm82">sexual </span><span id="ITerm83"/>problems as well (Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). Socially, family-of-origin attitudes regarding sexuality may be instilled early on and predispose the development of a sexual dysfunction. Assessing the quality of the individual’s current relationship is of utmost importance, as problems between the members of the couple may be a cause and/or a consequence of sexual problems. If so, these issues need to be appropriately addressed. Areas of inquiry related to intimate partnership should include anger, distrust, discrepancies in sexual drive, and preferences, communication, and physical attraction (Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>). The <span id="ITerm84">comorbidity</span> of partner sexual dysfunction is common and should be assessed and addressed if the partner(s) is/are willing to be present in the sessions. In addition, ethnocultural and religious attitudes and beliefs are important as they can be implicated in the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunctions (Hall &amp; Graham, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>; Levine et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>; Wincze &amp; Carey, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR75" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par19"><span id="ITerm85">Questionnaires</span> can be used to formally assess the presence and/or comorbidity of sexual dysfunctions. In addition, information from the client’s treating physician with respect to results from laboratory tests (e.g., for hormone function, vascular integrity, nerve function) and <span id="ITerm86">physical</span><span id="ITerm87"/> examinations (e.g., gynecological) will provide useful information for diagnosis and treatment.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading">Gender Dysphoria</h3><p class="Para" id="Par20">The <span id="ITerm88">most</span> recent guideline for the Standards of Care for Gender Diverse People—published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) in 2022 (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>) and freely available at <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.wpath.org/"><span class="RefSource">www.​wpath.​org/​</span></a></span>—makes several recommendations for healthcare professionals involved in the care of gender diverse individuals and outlines the process of mental health assessment of individuals with GD. The recommendations for healthcare <span id="ITerm89">professionals</span><span id="ITerm90"/> involved in the care of gender diverse adults are that they be: licensed by their statutory board with relevant training; competent in diagnosing mental health disorders preferably using the most recent edition of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (or another taxonomy); able to identify co-existing mental health and other psychosocial issues and distinguish these from GD, incongruence, and diversity; capable of assessing capacity to consent to treatment; experienced or qualified to assess clinical aspects of GD, incongruence, and diversity; continuing their education in health care related to GD, incongruence, and diversity; and open to multidisciplinary consultation and referral with other health care professionals <span id="ITerm91">involved</span><span id="ITerm92"/> in gender-affirming care (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). Additional recommendations are made for mental <span id="ITerm93">health care professionals</span> involved in gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment of children and adolescents with GD as well as with other gender-diverse individuals seeking care (e.g., eunuchs) (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">The role of mental health <span id="ITerm94">professionals</span><span id="ITerm95"/> involved in the care of gender diverse individuals consists of many aspects related to the overall well-being of their clients as well as the implementation of specific recommendations when discussing avenues of gender-affirming medical care. Mental health professionals play a critical role in multidisciplinary healthcare teams by conducting a comprehensive assessment to diagnose GD and addressing mental health symptoms that interfere with a client’s capacity to consent to gender-affirming care. Examples of interfering symptoms are cognitive impairment and the presence of psychosis; it is also important to understand that some mental health conditions may not affect the capacity to provide consent and should not be used as a reason to delay gender-affirming care, especially since such care is associated with decreases in mental health symptoms (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). In addition, mental health professionals address mental health conditions that can interfere with a client’s capacity to engage in essential perioperative care. For example, substance use disorder may impede engagement with appointments, and providing treatment for this condition and support for the client will be necessary for positive surgical outcomes (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). <span id="ITerm96">Additional </span><span id="ITerm97"/><span id="ITerm98">recommendations</span><span id="ITerm99"/> specific to mental health professionals can be found in the Standards of Care (Coleman et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Paraphilic Disorders</h3><p class="Para" id="Par22">This section will focus on the assessment procedures of adult men with paraphilic disorders. Very few women are identified with paraphilias, especially in forensic populations (for a review, see Cortoni, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>); in addition, paraphilic disorders are generally not diagnosed in adolescence given that this period of sexual development is believed to be exploratory and fluid, and a premature diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder could pathologize sexual behavior that is within a normal range developmentally (Seto, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR63" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Certain paraphilias and their associated disorders are more likely to be encountered in a <span id="ITerm100">forensic setting</span> (e.g., pedophilic disorder), and others are more common in traditional mental health settings (e.g., fetishistic disorder). In either case, the approach to the assessment will be similar, although a forensic setting is likely to be more concerned with broader issues such as risk to the public. In addition, those undergoing court assessments may be less inclined to be forthright than those seeking assessment of their own volition. Regardless, the assessment should be facilitated by a warm, respectful, empathic, genuine, and supportive demeanor on the part of the interviewer (Wilcox &amp; Gray, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR73" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA; <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.atsa.com/"><span class="RefSource">http://​www.​atsa.​com/​</span></a></span>) offers practice <span id="ITerm101">guidelines</span> for psychosexual evaluations, and these guidelines emphasize the need to <span id="ITerm102">use</span><span id="ITerm103"/> multiple sources of information, especially when the assessment is involuntary. Interviews should promote engagement, incorporate the client’s perspective, and consider responsivity factors, which refer to individual characteristics and learning differences that may impact treatment effectiveness. Assessors are encouraged to gather information that includes, but is not limited to, the following: psychosexual development; the nature and frequency of sexual practices; paraphilic interests that may not be sexually abusive; the use of sexually oriented services or outlets (including pornography); abusive or offense-related sexual arousal, interests, and preferences; the history of sexually abusive behaviors; information about current and/or previous victim(s); contextual elements of sexually abusive behaviors; and the individual’s level of insight, self-disclosure, and denial (Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>, pp. 18–21).</p></section>

<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec14"><h4 class="Heading">Viewing Time</h4><p class="Para" id="Par31">Viewing time (VT) measures (e.g., Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest; Abel et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a></span>) were <span id="ITerm120">developed</span><span id="ITerm121"/> to provide an objective but less intrusive assessment of sexual interests than phallometry (see below). In this approach, a test taker is shown a series of slides depicting pictures of clothed people of varying ages. Viewing time on each slide, measured beyond the <span id="ITerm122">test-taker’s </span><span id="ITerm123"/>awareness, as well as self-reported sexual interest are measured. Interest is measured by response delays induced by the preferred sexual content in stimuli to which the individuals are exposed, with the data-driven assumption that the test-taker will look longer at the images they find to be sexually attractive. Although some believe the weak psychometric properties of these procedures render them better used as a clinical tool than a risk assessment measure (e.g., Akerman &amp; Beech, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>), <span id="ITerm124">results</span><span id="ITerm125"/> of a meta-analysis demonstrate moderate discrimination between groups of sexual offenders and nonsexual offenders as well as significant convergent validity with other measures assessing sexual preference (Schmidt et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR62" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>). Amelung et al. (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a></span>) found that VT could also be useful outside of a forensic context to distinguish individuals presenting with pedo-hebephilia (i.e., sexual interests in pre-pubescent and pubescent children) without a <span id="ITerm126">history</span><span id="ITerm127"/> of offending.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec15"><h4 class="Heading">Phallometry</h4><p class="Para" id="Par32"><span id="ITerm128">Phallometry</span><span id="ITerm129"/> involves the direct measurement of penile responses when individuals are exposed to auditory or visual sexual stimuli. These can vary on specific dimensions of interest (e.g., age, gender, and level of coercion). Phallometric responses are recorded as increases in either penile circumference or volume with indices reflecting differential responses to sex-typical and paraphilic themes. Phallometric measures have been well validated, although problems remain with a lack of standardization in terms of procedures and stimuli across evaluation centers. A recent meta-analysis (McPhail et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR46" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>) supports the validity of phallometric testing for pedo-hebephilic propensities especially if audio and slides are used; the use of video stimuli was not supported. While concerns about the faking of test responses are well grounded and countermeasures are limited (Wilson &amp; Miner, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR74" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>), McPhail and colleagues <span id="ITerm130">stress</span><span id="ITerm131"/> that the validity of test results can be enhanced through the use of evidence-based practices and standardized procedures.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">It is <span id="ITerm132">recommended</span><span id="ITerm133"/> that users be trained in phallometry and familiar with its strengths and limitations because the results often carry a lot of weight (e.g., regarding access to biological children) (Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>). Furthermore, the results of such testing should never be used in isolation but rather be incorporated as part of a broader <span id="ITerm134">consideration</span><span id="ITerm135"/> of assessment information.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec16"><h4 class="Heading">Assessing Antisocial Tendencies</h4><p class="Para" id="Par34">Adherence to <span id="ITerm136">antisocial</span><span id="ITerm137"/> values is associated with increased rates of nonsexual recidivism for both sexual and nonsexual offenders (e.g., Witte et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>), and the assessment of such sentiments is generally included as part of a comprehensive evaluation of sexual abusers. In their most extreme form, antisocial tendencies are highly associated with criminal behavior, and, in their extreme, they present as psychopathy, which led Hare (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a></span>) to develop the <span id="ITerm138">Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R)</span> for forensic assessments. Psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy or conscience, manipulative behaviors, deceitfulness, along with impulsive and irresponsible behavior. The PCL-R has become widely used and accepted by forensic psychologists and the courts (Murrie et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR49" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a></span>). However, these authors demonstrated that the validity of PCL-R is eroded when users are not rigorously trained. Moreover, a subset of items measuring persistent and versatile criminality <span id="ITerm139">and</span><span id="ITerm140"/> aggression (Facet 4) fared better than all other PCL-R elements.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Criminogenic <span id="ITerm141">values</span><span id="ITerm142"/> have also been linked to an increased risk to engage in antisocial behavior. The Criminal Sentiments Scale (CSC<span id="ITerm143"/>; Andrews &amp; Wormith, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a></span>) measures attitudes toward the justice system and the degree to which an individual is tolerant of law violations and identifies with other criminals. A modified version (Simourd, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR66" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a></span>) has been shown to be a good predictor of future involvement in nonsexual criminal activity <span id="ITerm144">among</span><span id="ITerm145"/> sexual offenders (Witte et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR76" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>).</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec17"><h4 class="Heading">Risk Assessment</h4><p class="Para" id="Par36">Early risk assessment <span id="ITerm146">models</span> (before the mid-1990s) used unstructured professional judgment, which resulted in levels of prediction that were not much better than chance. Since the mid-1990s, tremendous strides in the development of risk assessment scales for sexual offenders have been made (Harris &amp; Hanson, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a></span>). Bonta and Andrews (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a></span>) summarized an important way of classifying risk factors into static versus dynamic/criminogenic factors, with static factors being historical/demographic factors that do not change over time (e.g., criminal history) and dynamic/criminogenic factors being those that can change and impact recidivism (e.g., sexual preoccupation levels). Not surprisingly, it is easier to gain inter-rater reliability on static tools, as they are based on file review with factors <span id="ITerm147">that </span><span id="ITerm148"/>are either present or absent or have an objective response. <span id="ITerm149">Dynamic</span> tools require intensive training on the part of the administrator in combination with the use of structured professional judgment in scoring the responses.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">In using any of the risk scales that include dynamic factors, assessors must be mindful of the potential for deceit in the individuals being assessed in their efforts to obtain a favorable evaluation. As noted earlier, Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a></span>) practice guidelines stress the need to include diverse, independent sources of information; doing so will greatly increase the validity of the scores obtained on risk assessment scales. If such information is lacking, a note to this effect should be made as a limitation of the assessment.</p><section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec18"><h5 class="Heading">Static Measures</h5><p class="Para" id="Par38">Globally, the Static-99R (Hanson &amp; Thornton, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a></span>) is the most commonly used and researched actuarial scale for assessing sexual risk potential (Helmus et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a></span>). The obtained score on this scale is compared with that of a large database of offenders from several countries, and the <span id="ITerm150">sexual</span> recidivism rates for those with a similar score can be assessed, predicting recidivism up to 10 years after <span id="ITerm151">release</span><span id="ITerm152"/> into the community. Based on extensive research, the likelihood of recidivism decreases with time spent being offense-free in the community, and the Static-99R allows for an alteration of the original score based on time being offense-free in the community during those 10 years (Hanson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a></span>). The <span id="ITerm153">Static-99R</span> has been validated with many cultural groups and across several countries, but some caution needs to be exercised when using it (Phenix et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR55" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>) given that risk assessment tools can perform less well with certain cultural groups (e.g., Indigenous offenders in Canada; Haag et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide (SORAG<span id="ITerm154"/>; Quinsey et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR57" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a></span>) is also a widely used actuarial scale. The SORAG items include considerations of an individual’s offense history, school <span id="ITerm155">adjustment</span>, alcohol use, and the presence of personality disorders, and it incorporates the PCL-R score among other factors. The obtained <span id="ITerm156">score</span><span id="ITerm157"/> is compared to actuarially derived recidivism rates for offenders with similar scores over seven and 10 years. The Violence Risk Appraisal Guide-Revised (VRAG-R; Rice et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR58" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a></span>) may be employed to assess the risk of general and sexual violence and may be used in place of the SORAG.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Since its introduction in the mid-1990s, the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool (MnSOST; Epperson et al., <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a></span>) and its most recent version (the MnSOST-4; Duwe, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>) have been widely used actuarial tools in screening sex offenders to prioritize them for sex offender programs and predicting level of risk, thereby helping to inform the level of community supervision required (Duwe, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a></span>).</p></section>

Kelly and David had abstained from sexual intercourse until their wedding night in keeping with their religious beliefs. In David’s words, “the wedding night was a disaster.” Kelly appeared very nervous and when they tried to have intercourse; she winced and complained of pain when he attempted vaginal penetration. The couple continued their attempts over the next few months and, although penetration eventually became possible, it remained intensely painful for Kelly. She also reported discomfort with tampon insertion, although of lower intensity. They had settled into a pattern of sexual interactions characterized by David’s entreaties to have sex, Kelly’s increasingly anxious attempts to avoid it, and the occasional sexual interaction (about once per month) that was painful for Kelly and unsatisfying for both. They <span id="ITerm166">rarely</span><span id="ITerm167"/><span id="ITerm168"/> discussed the problem. Kelly reported experiencing sexual desire and arousal during nonpainful <span id="ITerm169">sexual</span><span id="ITerm170"/> activities, but her desire/arousal plummeted when she anticipated or experienced the pain. In terms of their past, both reported supportive families and generally happy childhoods, with no history of physical or sexual abuse. They had no mental health concerns. David reported no sexual concerns, and they both reported a strong and satisfying nonsexual relationship.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">Areas targeted with psychometric measures were sexual dysfunction, pain-related experiences, and relationship adjustment. Consistent with the information obtained during the clinical interview, FSFI scores supported frequent pain experiences during insertional sexual activity for Kelly and the IIEF did <span id="ITerm171">not </span><span id="ITerm172"/><span id="ITerm173"/>reveal evidence of sexual dysfunction in David. A pain scale revealed high pain intensity scores, and her scores on measures of pain catastrophizing and anxiety were very high. The DAS confirmed their report of having a satisfying relationship outside of sexual activity. A referral was made to a gynecologist and a pelvic floor physical therapist with expertise in genitopelvic pain; results were consistent with a diagnosis of <span id="ITerm174">provoked vestibulodynia (PVD)</span>, a common cause of genitopelvic pain, with considerable hypertonicity (tightness) of the pelvic floor musculature. The findings from this assessment were used to design a multidisciplinary treatment <span id="ITerm175">plan</span><span id="ITerm176"/> that simultaneously targeted all problem areas: genitopelvic pain; feelings of guilt related to, and communication about, sex; hypertonicity; and pain catastrophizing and anxiety.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec23"><h3 class="Heading">Case 2</h3><p class="Para" id="Par45">Sarah, a 28-year-old trans <span id="ITerm177">woman,</span><span id="ITerm178"/><span id="ITerm179"/> was referred to sex therapy by her family doctor to obtain a letter for hormone therapy as this step was the next one in her physical transition to a feminine body. Sarah was designated male at birth, but since early childhood (3–4 years of age) recalled feeling distressed about “being a boy,” the stereotypical male toys that she was expected to play with, and the masculine clothing she was expected to wear. She identified as a girl since the age of 5. In her early school years, she avoided sports and all forms of rough-and-tumble play, played only with girls (and typically feminine toys), preferred to wear her hair long, and wore feminine clothing. When asked what she wanted to be “when she grew up,” Sarah would often respond “a woman.” Although she was often bullied by other children (typically boys), her parents, most other family members, and friends (girls) never questioned her choices. As Sarah approached puberty, she noted a sharp increase in distress (severe level) given the more obvious masculine changes that were occurring in her body, especially <span id="ITerm180">the</span><span id="ITerm181"/><span id="ITerm182"/> growth of facial hair, the development of a masculine body contour, and the deepening of her voice. Sarah identified as lesbian, and dated <span id="ITerm183">several </span><span id="ITerm184"/>partners throughout high school and beyond, eventually marrying her current partner, Samantha, at the age of 25. Sarah was always open about her gender with her partners, and Samantha was described as supportive of any changes that Sarah opted for in terms of her journey as a woman. Sarah dressed femininely, wore makeup and nail polish, and was working with a voice coach to raise her pitch. She also wore a padded bra to feel feminine. She was “out” in the trans community as well as with all close individuals in her social network, and she felt that she was ready to take the next step in terms of her physical transition (hormone therapy). Her distress level in terms of her physical body and being “misread” by others as male/man was moderate to high. She expressed realistic expectations in terms of the <span id="ITerm185">changes</span><span id="ITerm186"/><span id="ITerm187"/> that hormone therapy entailed, she understood the risks and benefits of the treatment, and she recognized the reproductive implications of the treatment. She was not interested in surgery at this time.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Upon examining her responses to the GIGDQ, Sarah’s gender identity was that of a woman, and her dysphoria was moderate to high. Her scores on anxiety and depression screening tools were in the moderate range. A letter detailing the diagnosis of GD and including the information required by WPATH was sent to a trans-friendly physician at a local clinic to support Sarah’s request for hormone therapy. In addition, Sarah was given a referral <span id="ITerm188">to </span><span id="ITerm189"/>a trans-friendly mental <span id="ITerm190">healthcare</span><span id="ITerm191"/><span id="ITerm192"/> professional to develop coping strategies for her depression and anxiety.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec24"><h3 class="Heading">Case 3</h3><p class="Para" id="Par47">John (age 56) was convicted of breaching a court order prohibiting contact with children. He babysat a 6-year-old boy who disclosed he had been touched inappropriately on his bottom by John. John had 10 prior sentencing dates over 30 years for a range of offenses; five of these were for sexual offenses. All involved boys aged 7–15. John was raised in an intact family by prosocial parents. However, he said his brother bullied him, which contributed to him acting out in school where his peers ostracized him. Behavioral problems emerged in elementary school and <span id="ITerm193">many</span><span id="ITerm194"/><span id="ITerm195"/> suspensions resulted. He was expelled in Grade 10, which ended his formal education. Throughout his adult years, John continued to struggle to make friends but enjoyed the support of his parents. He spent most of his free time alone and at home, which he preferred. John reported having been sexually abused by an adult male neighbor over a period of a few months when he was 7 years old. According to John, he did not see this experience as harmful. This abuse ended when the neighbor moved away. John recalled that he always had a “healthy” sex drive and that he often used sexual fantasy or masturbation to cope with his loneliness and sadness. John had never been in a cohabiting relationship with an age-appropriate partner but expressed that he would like to be; he described not knowing how to approach other adults and feeling overwhelmed by the thought of dating. VR and phallometric testing indicated equivalent <span id="ITerm196">responses</span><span id="ITerm197"/> to both pubescent <span id="ITerm198">and</span><span id="ITerm199"/><span id="ITerm200"/> pre-pubescent boys, a secondary but significant response to consenting men, and a negligible response to girls and women. He described being sexually attracted to men and admitted to an interest in boys aged 14–16. The results of the interview and testing were consistent with the diagnosis of Pedophilic Disorder.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">John participated in a treatment program in 2018 where few gains were made. He was described as being unreceptive to feedback and steadfast in asserting his victims “accepted and enjoyed” the abuse. He repeated this belief in the current assessment and stressed that he never pressured them and referred at times to having had a “relationship” with them. In regard to his current breach, John described it was “no big deal.” He denied touching the boy and portrayed his contact with the youth as a benign attempt to help a neighbor who required child care at short notice. He had no insight into his role in engineering these circumstances or the people who gave him access to his victims, and he portrayed his victims as the initiators of the sexual activity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">John’s PCL-R <span id="ITerm201">score</span><span id="ITerm202"/><span id="ITerm203"/> was below the criterion for designation as a psychopath. John’s scores on the Static-99R and Stable-2007 were consistent with a very strong risk of reoffending. On the Stable-2007, John’s results indicated treatment targets aimed at improving his deficits in forming and maintaining <span id="ITerm204">adult</span><span id="ITerm205"/> relationships, emotional identification with children, general social rejection, sexualized coping, deviant sexual preference, and problems in cooperating with supervision. A high-intensity sex offender <span id="ITerm206">program</span><span id="ITerm207"/><span id="ITerm208"/> was recommended.</p></section>
